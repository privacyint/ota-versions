Version: 7.0.0**

If you are using our UK specific applications, namely, Everyday Mental Health by Wysa mobile app or Digital Referral Assistant application then you need to read [this notice](https://legal.wysa.uk/privacy-policy).

You may try out one or more services made available to you. These include:

* A text or voice-based digital coach powered by an Artificial Intelligence chatbot (“AI Coach”).
* Clinically verified tools delivered over text or voice (“Digital tools”).
* Text or audio-video chats with a human mental health and well-being expert (“Wysa Coach”).

The aim of the app is to provide emotional wellbeing support in the form of an AI coach and the provision of a range of digital self-help tools and exercises in a self-help and self-monitoring context. The app can help with general mental health but not with severe or enduring physical or mental health conditions. The AI Coach is an AI technology powered software, not a real person, so it is restricted in the means of response. If you need medical advice, it will suggest that you see a local professional.

We will work with your public institution, healthcare institution, educational institution or other organization to offer our services. These are called Institutional services. Before you can use these Institutional services, you will need to agree to our notices and to the notices of your Institution.

By using our website, web pages, app and services, you agree that we can use your information as described in this privacy policy and any other related terms and policies ("notices").

4\. How We Protect Your Information

**Where is your information stored**  
The information we collect is saved and kept safe in our cloud servers managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Some of your information might be shared and stored with our third-party service providers to provide our services. For a list of service providers please read [here](https://legal.wysa.io/wysa-service-providers).

**How long do we keep your information**

**When you use our app and Services including Institutional Services**  

When you send us text messages, any personal identifier you share is removed and saved in a way that cannot be undone. We keep this information only for as long as we need to follow the law or our Institutional contracts. If there is no specific time limit mentioned, we keep your information for up to 10 years from the last time you updated it. You can also choose to delete all your conversation data forever by using the 'reset my data' option in the app settings.

**Your correspondence data**  

When you email us, we use the information you give to help you. We keep your emails safe in our Google Workspace account, and only certain staff can look at them. We will keep your email for up to 10 years from the last time you contacted us.

**When you use our DRA**  

We keep your information for the time your Institution has decided. After the agreed time, we delete your information forever from our systems. Once you submit the form and your information, we cannot change it. If you need to add or edit your personal data you will need to reach out to your Institution.

**When you use GenAI or Wysa+ service**  

We keep your personal and derived information in our and third-party service provider systems only for as long as needed to meet the purposes stated in our privacy policy or as required by law. Where available, we enable "no storage of data" controls with the service providers.

**Provision of personalised recommendations**  

We irreversibly remove any accidental personal identifiers from your conversation data prior to processing. All insights and recommendations are pseudonymised and encrypted in our system.

**Information received from your Institution**  

We keep your information for the time your Institution has decided. After that time, we delete your information forever. Once you send us your information, we cannot change it. If you need to fix something or have any questions, please talk to your Institution.

**When you join our research initiatives**  

You can stop participating in the research at any time after it starts. You can do this by using any of the suggested opt-out features or by sending an email to [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject "opt out of research study". Once you opt out, we will delete your study data within one year. However, the data you provided during research study will be kept according to our data retention policy. We will keep this information only for as long as we need. If there is no specific time limit mentioned, we keep your information for up to 10 years from the last time you updated it. After that, we delete your data from our system. Where required, we may retain one copy of your anonymised data for a longer duration for any future audit or verification purposes.

**Data Security**  

We use physical, organizational, and technical safeguards to keep your information safe. Here are some ways we do that:

**Protecting your privacy**

1. You do not need to register to use the app.
2. Just give us a nickname so our chatbot knows what to call you.
3. We use masked identifiers to keep your data and identity safe.
4. No real people can listen to what you are talking about with the AI Coach.
5. If you accidentally share personal data, we will make sure to remove it so no one can see it.
6. As an app user, you can choose "reset my data" to delete your information.
7. Before we use any personal data about you, we make sure it respects your rights.

**Protecting your security**

1. We use strong encryption to protect your data when it is being sent or stored.
2. Only authorised people can access your data. They have to use strong passwords and an additional access code.
3. All our staff computers have extra security.
4. We maintain contracts with companies we work with to keep your data safe.
5. We carefully check the background of new staff before hiring them.
6. We train our staff on how to handle your information securely.
7. We have experts from outside our company check if we are following the rules every year.
8. We regularly test our app and systems for any weaknesses.
9. We fix any problems in our computer code to make sure it is safe.
10. We often check to make sure we are following our safety plans and rules.

**Additional safeguards when you use Gen AI or Wysa+ Services**

1. Every message sent to and from Gen AI is encrypted so no one else can read it.
2. We check each message you send to make sure it does not have personal identifiers. This helps keep your private details safe from being shared with the Gen AI service provider.
3. We always check what is sent and received from Gen AI to make sure it is safe and good to use.
4. We also use safety rules to double-check and make sure everything is safe.
5. We do not share your device data with Gen AI.
6. Your conversation messages are never stored at the Gen AI.
7. Your conversation messages are not used as training data by Gen AI.

**Responsible use of Artificial Intelligence**

At Wysa, we use artificial intelligence (AI) programs to understand what you type to us. These programs help us talk with you in a way that makes sense and guides you to helpful information. Our programs follow set rules and do not learn new things on their own. We make sure our AI chatbot is fair, safe, and treats your information with care. If you use the Gen AI or Wysa+ service, we use Generative AI technology to assist you. We have safety measures in place to keep our conversations secure and trustworthy. We also have good practices to monitor and check the use of AI at Wysa, making sure your rights are protected. Please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you have any more questions about our use of AI.

While Wysa has put in place reasonable clinical safety and data protection controls, you understand and acknowledge that AI is a developing technology. The potential risks inherent to this technology may not be fully understood and fulsome safeguards may not be fully developed. Due to the nature of the technology, you may sometimes get incorrect responses that do not accurately reflect the action required.

We do our best to keep your personal data safe, but no method is perfect. We cannot promise complete security. You can help keep your data safe too. Please do not share personal identifiers where not asked. Please do not copy and share your chats with people you do not know.

**Payment Data**

We do not collect, keep, or store your credit card information. Third-party payment companies handle your card processing. We do not get any personal data from app stores after you buy something or from our third-party payment providers. However, we might note the name of the business for our internal purposes. Please read the payment gateway’s terms and privacy policy before you make a payment. We do receive and handle payment confirmations and subscription details. This is to help you with your subscription requests.

**Third-Party Sites**

The app might have links to other websites or resources. When you click on these links, remember that these other sites have their own rules about privacy. We do not control these other sites and we are not responsible for their privacy rules. It is a good idea to read their privacy rules before you share any personal data on those sites.

**Children’s Privacy**

The app is intended for anyone who is older than 13 years or where approved by your Institution, follow the age criteria and rules set by your Institution. If you are a child, please ask your parent or guardian to read this policy and the terms of service with you. We may need parental consent to use our service as required by applicable laws in your country of residence. You will require your parents or guardian to send their consent to [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or to your Institution if you are an Institutional user. Wysa does not take responsibility if someone misrepresents their age to use the app and services.

It is very important for us to protect children's privacy on the app. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children below the approved age. If you think we have any personal data of your child, please write to us. We will respond within one month after verifying the information. If we cannot identify the user correctly, we might not be able to address your request. However, if we find we have collected personal data from your child, we will deactivate their account and take steps towards removing relevant data.

We encourage parents and guardians to watch over their children's internet use. Tell your children not to give out personal information without your permission. You should not share your credit/debit card or other payment methods with your child to make in-app purchases.

**Best Practices**

We want to help you stay safe online. Here are some important tips to stay secure:

* Always lock your mobile screen with a password. Make sure it is strong and do not share it with anyone. Never leave your device alone.
* Always update your mobile’s operating system to the latest version.
* Turn on remote access on your device so you can find and control it if it gets stolen.
* Install anti-virus software to protect your device from viruses.
* Be careful with emails. Do not open files, click on links, or download anything from sources you do not know.
* Be smart about using Wi-Fi. Before sending personal or important data over a public Wi-Fi in places like a coffee shop or airport, check if the network is safe.

5\. Who We Share Information With

**Service Providers**  
We work with third party companies that help us run our app, fix any problems, and offer other important services. These companies might use your personal data to provide services for us. For a list of service providers please read [here](https://legal.wysa.io/wysa-service-providers).

**Legal**  
We sometimes need to use your personal data to follow the law. This might mean sharing your information with other people like insurance companies, courts, police, or other important organisations. We might also use your information to stop serious health or safety problems, for public health reports, and to keep information safe during legal situations so it is not changed. Also, we might share your information to help with finding out or stopping fraud or crime. We will make sure your rights and interests are protected.

**Reorganization**  
In situations like when we might sell our business, join up with another company, reorganize, or are facing bankruptcy, we may need to share some of your personal data with others. These third parties will use your information to look at the business deal. After these changes happen, we might also share your information with the new company for the same purposes mentioned in this privacy notice. We will try to let you know by putting a notice on our website, telling your Institution, sending you a notification in the app, or updating this privacy notice.

* * *

6\. Sharing Information Outside Your Country

Sometimes we need to share, store, and manage your information with our service providers. These service providers might be in countries where data protection is not as strong as it is here. We have agreements with our service provider that include data protection safeguards to keep your data safe.

We only share the necessary data between our Wysa offices to provide you with the best service. We use strong technology to keep your data safe.

If you have any questions about how we send your data to other countries, you can email us at [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

7\. Your Data Protection Rights

**When you trigger “Reset my data” from app settings**

The "Reset my Data" feature is found in the app settings of the app. If you use this feature, all your conversation information, including your ID, past chats, reminders, assessment answers, and settings will be deleted from our system. Once you reset, you cannot get back any of your old conversations and you will be treated like a new user. So, think carefully before using this feature.

Do note, any data collected, stored, and processed by Wysa Medical Assistants or well-being advisors for Wysa Co-pilot service will not be deleted when you opt for "Reset my data". This is to ensure continuity of care with your Institutional provider.

By using our services, you consent to let us use AI for this purpose. We might change the automated approach we use in the future.
