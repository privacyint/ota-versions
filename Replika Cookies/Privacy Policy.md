Cookie Policy
=============

Last updated: March 22, 2023

This Cookie Policy explains how Luka, Inc. (“**Replika**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” and/or “**our**”) uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website at [replika.com](https://replika.com/) — as mirrored at [replika.ai](https://replika.ai/) — (“**Website**”) or mobile applications (“**Apps**”). We refer to the Website and Apps collectively as the “**Services**”. Here, we explain what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

This Cookie Policy should be read in conjunction with our [Privacy Policy](https://replika.com/legal/privacy). If you have any questions or concerns about the Cookie Policy or its implementation, please contact us at [privacy@replika.com](mailto:privacy@replika.com), or as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy.

[#](#1.-what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies%3F) 1. What are cookies and similar technologies?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Cookies**. A cookie is a text file containing a string of characters that is sent to your device when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Replika) are called “first party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies.” Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through a website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

**Local storage**. Local storage technologies refer to the methods that websites and applications use to store data locally on your device. The most commonly used local storage technology is called “local Storage” and is part of the HTML5 standard. This technology allows websites or applications to store data that persists even after the user closes their browser or application, or restarts their device.

**Session storage**. Session storage is a feature of your web browser or device that allows a website or application to temporarily store data on your device while you are actively using the website or application. This data is deleted as soon as you close your browser or application, or navigate away from the website. Websites and applications may use session storage to improve your experience and ensure that certain information is readily available during your browsing session.

**Other tracking technologies**. Websites and apps use a variety of other tracking technologies too, including web beacons (also known as tracking pixels), third-party tracking scripts, advertising pixels, and analytics tools. These technologies provide data on how visitors use websites and allow websites to serve personalized advertisements. We may also use web beacons and “clear GIFs” in promotional emails and other communications with you, to allow us to count how many people read them and to verify any clicks through to links within an email. If you do not wish for the web beacon to be downloaded onto your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “**cookies**.”

[#](#2.-what-type-of-information-do-cookies-collect%3F) 2. What type of information do cookies collect?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We, our service providers, and our advertising partners automatically log information about an individual’s interactions with our Services, such as:

* Device information, such as computer or mobile device operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 5G), and general location information such as city, state, or geographic area.
* Online activity information, such as pages or screens viewed, how long individuals spend on a page or screen, the website they visited before browsing to our Website, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about activity on a page or screen, access times and duration of access, and whether individuals open our marketing emails or click links within them.

We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to remember any preferences you have or choices you make when you use our Website.
