#### How Manatal Holds and Secures Your Information

We care about the security of your Personal Information, and take appropriate steps including technical and organizational measures to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Information.

#### International Data Transfers

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).

Specifically, our Website servers are located in the United States, and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy.

However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at support@manatal.com.

#### How Long Manatal retains your personal information

We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will securely store your Personal Information until it is deleted or you ask us to delete it.

#### Your Data Protection Rights

You have the following data protection rights:

* If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your Personal Information, you can do so at any time by contacting us at support@manatal.com.

Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us at support@manatal.com.
* You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.  To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us at support@manatal.com.
* Similarly, if we have collected and process your Personal Information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
* You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

We authorize these subprocessors to use the information only as necessary to assist Manatal in providing the Services (for example, to provide cloud storage services, interview calendaring, support ticketing, or to help to enhance security). We require these subprocessors by contract to safeguard the privacy and security of any Personal Information that they process on our behalf;

* To any other person with your consent to the disclosure.

Our customers may choose to integrate their Manatal accounts with other third party service providers.  While we try to choose integration partners that share our standards for privacy, their websites and services are outside of our control and are not covered by this Services Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their content, security, or privacy practices.
