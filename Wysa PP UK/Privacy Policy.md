Wysa is a company with offices in the UK, India, and the USA. In the UK, we are registered with the UK Information Commissioner Office. Our registration number is ZB272754.

Where Wysa decides the purpose of personal data processing, we will be the data controllers. Where we perform personal data processing at the intent and direction of your Institution, we will be data processors.

If you have any questions, comments, complaints, or requests about our app and services, you can email us at [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

2\. What Information We Collect and Use

Depending on how you interact with us, we may collect personal data that can be used to identify you. Notably personal data does not include publicly available information or anonymised or aggregated information.

**When you use our app and services.**

When you use our app and services, we collect the following information. You control the information you share with us. We design our app to collect as little personal data as possible to keep your data safe and protect your privacy. This means there is less risk of your information being misused. When you share information with us, we are responsible for taking care of it.

**Information provided by you.**

* **Information about you.** This includes things like your nickname, age-range, gender, pronouns, or identifiers you may voluntarily reveal about yourself.
    
* **Conversation data.** This covers what you type in messages, your challenges, preferences, feelings, moods, thoughts, task lists, and safety information. It also includes answers to surveys or questionnaires from us or your Institution, and how you respond to the tools and exercises that we offer.
    
* **Correspondence data.** If you email us, you might share personal data like your name, email address, home address, the company you are part of, your job title, and what you talk about in the message.
    
* **Feedback data.** When we ask for your thoughts on our app and services, we gather your contact info and some basic details about you.
    
* **Pharmacovigilance data.** This is only for services provided for pharmaceutical institutions. On behalf of your Institution, we may ask you to provide safety related inputs regarding your use of medications. This may include any drug side effects, adverse events or other experiences when using the Institution prescribed drugs. You will be routed to the Institution or regulator webpage where you can provide your inputs.
    

**Information collected via automated means or by third parties.**

* **Information sharing with your Institution**. Sometimes, your Institutions or their appointed representatives might share or ask you to share your personal data, such as your name, date of birth, Institution identifiers, contact details among others, so we can offer you our services. We may also share your usage and safety data with your Institution as part of our services.
    
* **App event data.** We collect information about what you do in the app, like where you tap, what actions you take, your settings, notifications you get, and the screens you visit.
    
* **Device data.** When you install the App, we get an ID for your device from the Google Play Store or Apple Play Store. We also collect information about your device, like the type of phone, its time zone, and its operating system. A service provider that helps us securely deliver content might also collect your IP address to help us provide our services.
    
* **Cookie Information.** We and our third-party providers collect information about your app use via cookies or similar technologies. We use mandatory or necessary cookies to provide our services.
    

**When you use our DRA services**

When you use the DRA on your Institution website to make a referral submission, we will need to collect some information on behalf of your Institution. This information is transferred to the Institution and/or their service providers for review by a clinician.

You can fill out the information required at your own pace. We will obtain your personal data directly from the Institution (such as member id, plan details, demographic information). We will also ask for personal details (such as name, date of birth, contact details), answers to health related questions, and any long-term health issues or disabilities within the DRA form itself. Your Institution decides if you qualify for these services, not us.

We do not decide who is accepted by the institution, nor the type or step of care provided. The DRA only collects the required information and passes it to your Institution and/or their authorised service providers.

**When you use CCBT programs and/or Therapist Companion Service.**

Note: This service is currently available only for research and clinical investigation purposes.

Wysa will only share the needed personal data with your Institution and their clinician. This to help them review your progress on the assigned CCBT programs and/or receive communication using the Therapist Companion service. These details can include, but are not limited to, CCBT program progress, notes from the clinician, check-in dates, assessment results, and any emergency alerts.

**When you use the CYP referral service as a CYP user**

If you need extra help, you will be asked to fill in a form in the Waitlist App with your personal details and contact information. Based on the submission, a clinician from your Institution can get in touch with you. We use this information, on behalf of your Institution, to make sure you get the support you need.

**When you use the Wysa+ service**

Wysa+ provides an improved experience of the AI Coach service. It allows us to provide you with high-quality, and safe, responses. Wysa+ uses third-party Generative AI (“Gen AI”) and our own AI to chat with you. This helps the AI Coach talk about varied conversations and provide responses that are more suited to you. Where provided, Wysa+ allows you to chat in native English and other languages. Your conversation data is processed to provide this service. The output from the Gen AI passes through our safety guardrails and quality checks before we use it. Our clinical staff review the appropriateness of the Gen AI response at frequent intervals to make sure they are safe, and work well.

**When you join our testing or research initiatives**

You can choose to sign up and join any of our online testing or research studies. When you volunteer, we will collect some information from you. These include:

* **Information about you.** This may include (but is not limited to) your name, contact details, country, gender, socio-economic details, age-range.
    
* **Health and Wellness data.** If you participate in our research study we may collect additional information such as ethnicity, alcohol/substance use concerns, mood, and validated assessment responses.
    

**Sources of personal data**

We get your personal data either from you, your Institution, or service providers your Institution asks us to work with.

4\. How We Protect Your Information

**Where is your information stored**  
The information we collect is saved and kept safe in our cloud servers managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Some of your information might be shared and stored with our third-party service providers to provide our services.

**How long do we keep your information**

**When you use our Waitlist App and Services including Institutional Services**  

When you send us text messages, any personal identifier you share is reasonably removed and saved in a way that cannot be undone. We keep this information only for as long as we need to follow the law or our Institutional contracts. If there is no specific time limit mentioned, we keep your information for up to 10 years from the last time you updated it. After that, we delete your data from our system. Where required by law, we may retain one copy of your data. You can also choose to delete all your conversation data forever by using the 'reset my data' option in the App settings.

**Your correspondence data**  

When you email us, we use the information you give to help you. We keep your emails safe in our Google Workspace account, and only certain staff can look at them. We will keep your email for up to 10 years from the last time you contacted us. We may archive your messages longer where required by the law.

**When you use our DRA or CYP referral service(for CYP users)**  

We keep your information for the time your Institution has decided. After the agreed time, we delete your information forever from our systems. Once you submit the form and your information, we cannot change it. If you need to add or edit your personal data you will need to reach out to your Institution.

**When you use Wysa+ service**  

We keep your personal and derived information in our and third-party service provider systems only for as long as needed to meet the purposes stated in our privacy policy or as required by law. Where available, we enable "no storage of data" controls with the service providers.

**When you join our testing or research initiatives**  

You can stop participating in the testing or research at any time after it starts. You can do this by using any of the suggested opt-out features or by sending an email to [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject "opt out of Wysa testing/study". Once you opt out, we will delete your study data within one year. However, the data you provided during research study or testing will be kept according to our data retention policy. We will keep this information only for as long as we need. If there is no specific time limit mentioned, we keep your information for up to 10 years from the last time you updated it. After that, we delete your data from our system. Where required, we may retain one copy of your anonymised data for a longer duration for any future audit or verification purposes.

**Data Security**  

We use physical, organizational, and technical safeguards to keep your information safe. Here are some ways we do that:

**Protecting your privacy**

1. You do not need to register to use the app.
2. Just give us a nickname so our chatbot knows what to call you.
3. We use pseudonymized identifiers to keep your data and identity safe.
4. No real people can listen to what you are talking about with the AI Coach.
5. If you accidentally share personal data, we will make sure to remove it so no one can see it.
6. As a Waitlist App user, you can choose "reset my data" to delete your conversation data.
7. Before we use any personal data about you, we make sure it respects your rights.

**Protecting your security**

1. We use strong encryption to protect your data when it is being sent or stored.
2. We use secure application interfaces and secure data transfer protocols.
3. Only certain people can access your data. They have to use strong passwords and an additional access code.
4. All our staff computers have extra security.
5. We maintain contracts with companies we work with to keep your data safe.
6. We carefully check the background of new staff before hiring them.
7. We train our staff on how to handle your information securely.
8. We have experts from outside our company check if we are following the rules every year.
9. We regularly test our app and systems for any weaknesses.
10. We fix any problems in our computer code to make sure it is safe.
11. We often check to make sure we are following our safety plans and rules.

**Additional safeguards when you use Wysa+ Services**

1. Every message sent to and from Gen AI is encrypted so no one else can read it.
2. We check each message you send to make sure it does not have personal identifiers. This helps keep your private details safe from being shared with the Gen AI service provider.
3. We always check what is sent and received from Gen AI to make sure it is safe and good to use.
4. We also use safety rules to double-check and make sure everything is safe.
5. We do not share your device data with Gen AI.
6. Your conversation messages are never stored at the Gen AI.
7. Your conversation messages are not used as training data by Gen AI.

**Responsibe use of Artificial Intelligence**

At Wysa, we use artificial intelligence (AI) programs to understand what you type to us. These programs help us talk with you in a way that makes sense and guides you to helpful information. Our programs follow set rules and do not learn new things on their own. We make sure our AI chatbot is fair, safe, and treats your information with care. If you use the Wysa+ service, we use third-party Generative AI technology to assist you. We have safety measures in place to keep our conversations secure and trustworthy. We also have good practices to monitor and check the use of AI at Wysa, making sure your rights are protected. Please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you have any more questions about our use of AI.

While Wysa has put in place reasonable clinical safety and data protection controls, you understand and acknowledge that AI is a developing technology. The potential risks inherent to this technology may not be fully understood and fulsome safeguards may not be fully developed. Due to the nature of the technology, you may sometimes get incorrect responses that do not accurately reflect the action required.

We do our best to keep your personal data safe, but no method is perfect. We cannot promise complete security. You can help keep your data safe too. Please do not share personal identifiers where not asked. Please do not copy and share your chats with people you do not know.

**Third-Party Sites**

The App might have links to other websites or resources. When you click on these links, remember that these other sites have their own rules about privacy. We do not control these other sites and we are not responsible for their privacy rules. It is a good idea to read their privacy rules before you share any personal data on those sites.

**Children’s Privacy**

The apps are meant to be used only by people allowed by your Institution. If you are too young according to your Institution rules, you should not use this App. Wysa is not responsible if someone lies about their age to use the apps. If you find out that a child has shared personal data with us when they should not have, tell us by sending an email. We encourage parents and guardians to watch over their children's internet use. Tell your children not to give out personal information without your permission.

**Best Practices**

We want to help you stay safe online. The NCSC Gov.UK website has tips on how to make your devices more secure. The UK ICO site gives easy advice on protecting your personal data when you are online and using computers or other gadgets. You can check out the links below to learn more.

5\. Who We Share Information With

**Service Providers**  
We work with third-party companies that help us run our app, fix any problems, and offer other important services. These companies might use your personal data to provide services for us. For a list of service providers please read [here](https://legal.wysa.uk/wysa-service-providers).

We also work with the Institution’s authorised service providers to connect and share your information so you may get the required care from your Institution.

**Legal**  
We sometimes need to use your personal data to follow the law. This might mean sharing your information with other people like insurance companies, courts, police, or other important organisations around the world. This could happen if they are checking something, during court cases, or if it is required by law. We might also use your information to stop serious health or safety problems, for public health reports, and to keep information safe during legal situations so it is not changed. Also, we might share your information to help with finding out or stopping fraud or crime. We will make sure your rights and interests are protected.

**Reorganization**  
In situations like when we might sell our business, join up with another company, reorganize, or are facing bankruptcy, we may need to share some of your personal data with others. These third-parties will use your information to look at the business deal. After these changes happen, we might also share your information with the new company for the same purposes mentioned in this privacy notice. We will try to let you know by putting a notice on our website, telling your Institution, sending you a notification in the app, or updating this privacy notice.

6\. Sharing Information Outside the UK

To help us run our apps and services, we sometimes need to move your data to other countries. Some of these countries might not have strict data protection laws. When we move your personal data from places in Europe and the UK, we make sure to take extra steps to keep it safe. When we send your personal data to places that have good protections, we do not need to take any extra steps. Sometimes, our trusted third-party service providers might need to send your data outside the UK or Europe. We have agreements with our service providers that include data protection safeguards to keep your data safe. We only share the necessary data between our Wysa offices to provide you with the best service. We use strong technology to keep your data safe.

If you have any questions about how we send your data to other countries, you can email us at [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

7\. Your Data Protection Rights

**When you trigger “Reset my data” from app settings**

The "Reset my Data" feature is found in the app settings of the Waitlist App. If you use this feature, all your conversation information, including your ID, past chats, reminders, assessment answers, and settings will be deleted from our system. Once you reset, you cannot get back any of your old conversations and you will be treated like a new user. So, think carefully before using this feature.

**Your Privacy Rights**

**What Can You Do About Your Data?**

* Ask Questions: You can ask us how we are using your personal data.
* Get a Copy: You can ask for a copy of the information we have about you.
* Fix It: If any information about you is wrong or missing, you can ask us to fix it.

We change our conversation anytime you inform us that the AI is not helping. We and our service providers might use AI to make automated decisions or automatically process information if we need to perform our services or to stop fraud, abuse or misuse of our services. By using our Services, you consent to let us use AI for this purpose. We might change the automated approach we use in the future.

**How to Exercise Your Rights**

You do not usually have to pay anything to use your rights. Sometimes, we might need to check it’s really you asking. Contact us using the details at the top of this privacy notice. We will reply within one month if you ask us for something.

**When We Might Say “No”**  
We might not be able to agree to your request if:

* The law says we cannot.
* It affects someone else’s privacy.
* It could harm you, us, or someone else.
