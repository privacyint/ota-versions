    #### 
    
    Latest Revised Date: July 19, 2024 (GMT)
    
    Version: 1.2.6
    
    This Cookie Policy explains how Touchkin eServices Pvt. Ltd and its worldwide affiliates (“Touchkin” or “Wysa” or “We” or “Us” or “Our”), partners and service providers use cookies and similar technologies when You visit Our Websites or Product (in this Policy, We refer to these Websites or products, collectively, as the “Sites”). This Cookie Policy explains generally what these technologies are, why We use them and Your rights to control Our use of them on Our Sites.
    
    ### 
    
    Sites Definitions:
    
    * Wysa Website ([Wysa.com](https://www.wysa.com/)): Wysa’s informational website hosting information about the company and the product

    What Are Cookies?
    
    Cookies are small pieces of data (memory files) stored on Your computer or device via Your browser by Sites You visit. First-party cookies are cookies that We place on Your device when You visit the Sites. Third-party cookies are cookies that another party places on Your device when You visit the Sites. We allow third-parties to use cookies on the Sites. Third-party cookies and the use of information collected by third-party cookies on the Sites are governed by the privacy policies of the third-parties that set the cookies on Your device, even though they are being set on Your device when You visit Our Site.
    
    We also use other technologies similar to cookies, such as Web beacons, which may, for example, help Us deliver cookies and understand usage and traffic on the Sites.
    
    ### 
    
    How long will cookies and similar technologies stay on my device?
    
    The length of time a cookie will stay on Your device depends on whether the cookie is a session cookie or a persistent cookie. Session cookies are temporary, only stay on Your device while Your browser is open and are automatically deleted when You close Your browser. Persistent cookies stay on Your device until they expire or You or Your browser deletes them. The Sites use both session and persistent cookies. Other similar technologies vary in how long they may stay active as well.
    
    ### 
    
    Why do We use these technologies?
