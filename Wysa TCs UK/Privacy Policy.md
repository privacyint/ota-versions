Important Information for Using The app and services

1. If you are thinking about hurting yourself or others, or have a serious physical or mental health emergency, stop using the app right away. Call your local emergency service or if you are under the age of 16, tell your parents or guardian so they can get you help.
2. You should be the right age to use the app. Your Institution may set age limits. Wysa is not responsible if you are using the apps but under the specified minimum age requirement.
3. We do not ask for your personal data unless it is needed for your Institution. We only collect the data we need to help you. Read our privacy policy and related policies to understand how we use your data.
4. Where required for provisioning care by your Institution, We may receive personal data from your Institution and may share your data with third-party service providers authorised by the Institution and/or opted by you.

6. The apps will not offer medical or clinical advice and will only suggest that you seek professional or medical help.
7. The app can help with general mental health but not with severe or enduring physical or mental health conditions. If you have health problems, check with your clinician before using the apps.

Intended Use of Our App and Services

With the apps, you can chat with an artificial intelligence (AI) coach to get access to tools and techniques to help manage your emotions and support your mental and behavioural health and well-being.

**Digital Referral Assistant application (“DRA” or “Referral web widget”) intended use**

* The DRA is an AI enabled conversational agent software designed to support client services (“Institution”) that offer and/or provide mental health care.
* The DRA collects and transfers a range of demographic and screening information, as defined and agreed by the client service, to Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems for review by the client service clinician.
* The DRA software uses transparent conditional logic to minimise the question flow for individual users and surface flags to indicate priority areas for client service clinician attention.
* The DRA software is intended for use in adults age 16 or older and does not suggest potential diagnoses or replace clinical judgement.

**About the DRA services**

* The DRA enables you to self-refer into and find out if you qualify for certain mental health services such as talking therapies.
* Wysa does not decide who gets the help, nor the type or step of care provided – we just help collect the required information and pass it to your Institution.
* The rules for eligibility are set by the Institution providing the service, not by Wysa.
* You will be asked some initial questions to see if you qualify.
* If you qualify, more questions will follow to help with your referral.
* Your information is shared with the Institution and/or their service providers, to help them provide the right care for you.
* The DRA cannot offer condition specific advice for any medical conditions nor is it intended to provide a diagnosis, prognosis, treatment or cure of any illnesses, disability or health conditions.
* The client service clinician uses the data transferred for checking symptoms to provide appropriate care and not for diagnoses.

**Everyday Mental Health by Wysa mobile app (“Waitlist App”) intended use**

* The Waitlist App is a stand alone application available on android, IOS or over the web for the self-help and self-monitoring of mental wellbeing by individuals.
* The Waitlist App is an AI-driven conversational agent intended to assist individuals with subclinical or clinical symptoms of anxiety or low mood in managing emotional distress through evidence based techniques such as CBT, goal setting and emotional acceptance.
* The software provides feedback and personalised insights based on user-input data and helps users set meaningful personal goals and take actionable steps towards positive change.
* It is intended for use by individuals over the age of 13 (or 11+ if agreed by the provider) as a stand alone support tool or in conjunction with regular physical or mental health focussed clinical care (during waiting periods, between appointments, and/or as an adjunct to individual or group therapy).
* It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, and does not provide medical advice or diagnoses.
* It is not recommended for use in crisis situations, nor is it suitable for use by those with severe and enduring mental health problems.

**About the AI Coach service**

* The AI Coach is not a human, but an artificial intelligence system. So it is restricted in the means of response.
* The app provides evidence-based tools to help you feel better and manage your mood.
* The AI Coach cannot provide any medical advice.
* It can help with general mental health but not with severe or enduring physical or mental health conditions.
* It cannot offer condition specific advice for any medical conditions nor is it intended to provide a diagnosis, prognosis, treatment or cure of any illnesses, disability or health conditions.

**About the Wysa+ services**

* Wysa+ service is a new and improved version of the AI Coach service.
* It allows us to provide you with high-quality, and safe responses.
* Wysa+ uses third-party Generative AI (“Gen AI”) and our own AI to chat with you.
* It helps the AI Coach talk about varied conversations and provide responses that are more suited to you.

**Therapist Companion (“Co-Pilot”) intended use**

* This application and service is currently available only for research and clinical investigation purposes.
* If your Institution offers it, you can access a version of the Waitlist App that offers CCBT Programmes.
* These Programmes are recommended by your Institution or a Clinician.
* You can also interact with your assigned Clinician through the Waitlist App.

**Privacy and Data Handling**

Please read our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.wysa.uk/privacy-policy) to see how we protect and handle your data.
