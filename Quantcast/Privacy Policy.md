_If you have an active, duly executed contract for Quantcast services (“_**_Existing Contract_**_”), the Existing Contract will govern your use of the service(s) covered in the Existing Contract instead of these Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (“_**_Terms_**_”). In addition, these Terms only apply to the Quantcast Measure service (i.e., the “_**_Service_**_” as described below) and not to any other Quantcast product or service._

**Quantcast Measure Terms of Service**

This Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (this **_“Agreement”_)** describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure (the **_“Services”_)** available to you.

BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING THE SERVICES OR ENTERING INTO AN OFFLINE AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT OR INCLUDES A LINK TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.

This Agreement incorporates the [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum) to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the [Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners.](https://legal.quantcast.com/#privacy-implementation-for-quantcast-publisher-partners)

  

**1\. Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.**

Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, **“_Reachpoints_”)** for direct measurement.

You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.

Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, **“_Measurement Data_”**). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the **“_Measurement Results_”,** which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).

To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an **_“Authorized Affiliate”_**); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.

  

**2\. Registration.**

In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access [here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#quantcast-website-and-corporate-privacy-policy).

You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions

provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.

  

**3\. Measurement Data and Results.**

Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.

Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.

Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:

1. Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast [www.quantcast.com](https://www.quantcast.com/)”;
2. Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
3. Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
4. Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.

  

**4\. Tagging Rules and Privacy.**

You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. You further agree not to tag any website that contains information about health conditions or treatments or that might otherwise reveal or suggest an individual’s health status or treatment. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a [Quantcast Learning Center Guide](https://help.quantcast.com/hc/en-us). You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.

You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web

pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the [IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf) or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and

(iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.

You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.

In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the **“_Ad Preference Setting_”**). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.

Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement.

Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.

If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.

You represent and warrant that you are not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and you do not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations.

  

**5\. Restrictions.**

You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:

1. Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
2. Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
3. Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
4. Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.

  

**6\. Quantcast Rights.**

All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (**“_Quantcast Property_”**). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly

display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.

Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.

  

**7\. Indemnity.**

Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement. **The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.**

You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.

  

**8\. Warranty Disclaimer.**

**The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.**

  

**9\. Suspension and Termination.**

Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing [contact@quantcast.com](mailto:contact@quantcast.com) (if you are resident in the US) or [contact.dublin@quantcast.com](mailto:contact.dublin@quantcast.com) (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for

termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.

  

**10\. Modification of the Service and of the Terms.**

Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services will constitute your acceptance thereof.

  

**11\. Limitation of Liability.**

**In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.**

Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).

  

**12\. Miscellaneous.**

This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast.

You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.** This Agreement is drafted in the English language.

In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.

Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.

  

**7\. Indemnity.**

Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement. **The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.**

You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.

Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.**

  

**9\. Suspension and Termination.**

Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing contact@quantcast.com (if you are resident in the US) or contact.dublin@quantcast.com (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints.

Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services will constitute your acceptance thereof.

  

**11\. Limitation of Liability.**

**In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.**

Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).

Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast. **This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.** This Agreement is drafted in the English language.

_If you have an active, duly executed contract for Quantcast services (“_**_Existing Contract_**_”), the Existing Contract will govern your use of the service(s) covered in the Existing Contract instead of these Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (“_**_Terms_**_”). In addition, these Terms only apply to the Quantcast Measure service (i.e., the “_**_Service_**_” as described below) and not to any other Quantcast product or service._

**Quantcast Measure Terms of Service**

This Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (this **_“Agreement”_)** describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure (the **_“Services”_)** available to you.

BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING THE SERVICES OR ENTERING INTO AN OFFLINE AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT OR INCLUDES A LINK TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.

This Agreement incorporates the [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://www.quantcast.com/legal/us-data-privacy-addendum/) to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the [Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners](https://www.quantcast.com/legal/publisher-partner-privacy-implementation/).

1. **Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.**

Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, **“_Reachpoints_”)** for direct measurement.

You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.

Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, **“_Measurement Data_”**). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the **“_Measurement Results_”,** which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).

To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an **_“Authorized Affiliate”_**); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.

1. **Registration.**

In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access [here](https://www.quantcast.com/legal/privacy-website/).

You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.

1. **Measurement Data and Results.**

Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.

Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.

Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:

1. Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast [www.quantcast.com](https://www.quantcast.com/)”;
2. Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
3. Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
4. Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.
5. **Tagging Rules and Privacy.**

You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a [Quantcast Learning Center Guide](https://help.quantcast.com/hc/en-us). You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.

You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the [IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf) or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.

You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.

In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the **“_Ad Preference Setting_”**). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.

Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement. Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.

If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.

1. **Restrictions.**

You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:

In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.

Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.

1. **Indemnity.**

Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement. **The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.**

You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.

**Quantcast Measure and Q for Publishers Terms of Service**

**Effective: January 1, 2020**

Once you have agreed to these **Terms and Conditions** you will be able to download and install the Quantcast Measure Tag. These terms will apply only after such download and installation.

This Quantcast Measure and Q for Publishers Terms of Service (this **_“Agreement”_**) describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure and Q for Publishers (the **_“Services”_**) available to you.

BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS “YOU” OR “YOUR” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.

1. **Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.**

Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, “**_Reachpoints_**”) for direct measurement.

You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.

Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, “**_Measurement Data_**”). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the “**_Measurement Results_**”, which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3). For more information about how the Services work, please see our [FAQ](https://www.quantcast.com/faq/quantcast-services/).

To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an _“_**_Authorized Affiliate_**_”_); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.

2. **Registration.**

In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Data when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Privacy Policy which you can access [here](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/).

You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken—and instructions provided to Quantcast—under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.

3. **Measurement Data and Results.**

Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast’s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.

Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.

Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:

1. Credit Us. Conspicuously include: “Source: Quantcast [www.quantcast.com](https://www.quantcast.com/)”;
2. Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);
3. Don’t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and
4. Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.

4. **Tagging Rules and Privacy.**

You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, if you are an EU established company or person or your Reachpoints are directed towards end users in the EU, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing other sensitive or special category Personal Data, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Data from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a [Quantcast Learning Center Guide](https://help.quantcast.com/hc/en-us). You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag’s origin address that we provided, in full.

You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users in the EU, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the [IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf) (such as [Quantcast Choice](https://www.quantcast.com/products/choice-consent-management-platform/)) or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. Wherever possible, you agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Data is collected through your webpages or apps.

You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for non-EU established companies or a consent revocation page for EU established companies. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.

In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the “**_Ad Preference Setting_**”). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.

To the extent that GDPR applies, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent data controllers of any Personal Data which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of processing of any Personal Data disclosed or received under this Agreement.

To the extent that CCPA applies, Quantcast is a Third Party in its relationship with you regarding your use of the Services.

If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.

5. **Restrictions.**

You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Service to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:

1. Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
2. Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
3. Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
4. Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.

6. **Quantcast Rights.**

All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (“**_Quantcast Property_**”). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.

Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.

7. **Indemnity.**

Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement. **The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.**

You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.

8. **Warranty Disclaimer.**

**The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.**

9. **Suspension and Termination.**

Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing [contact@quantcast.com](mailto:contact@quantcast.com) (if you are resident in the US) or [contact.dublin@quantcast.com](mailto:contact.dublin@quantcast.com) (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.

10. **Modification of the Service and of the Terms.**

Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services, after 30 days, will constitute your acceptance thereof.

11. **Limitation of Liability.**

**In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.**

Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).

12. **Miscellaneous.**

This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast. **This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.** This Agreement is drafted in the English language. Any translation into another language is provided for convenience only. In the event of any inconsistency between the English language version and any translation, the English language version shall prevail.

Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.

To the extent that GDPR applies, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent data controllers of any Personal Data which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of processing of any Personal Data disclosed or received under this Agreement.

To the extent that CCPA applies, Quantcast is a Third Party in its relationship with you regarding your use of the Services.

If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.

5. **Restrictions.**

You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Service to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:

1. Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;
2. Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;
3. Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or
4. Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.

6. **Quantcast Rights.**

All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (“**_Quantcast Property_**”). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement’s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.

Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher’s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.

7. **Indemnity.**

Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast’s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast’s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement. **The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.**

You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.

8. **Warranty Disclaimer.**

**The services and related information are provided “as is,” without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.**

9. **Suspension and Termination.**

Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) “dequantifying” by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing [contact@quantcast.com](mailto:contact@quantcast.com) (if you are resident in the US) or [contact.dublin@quantcast.com](mailto:contact.dublin@quantcast.com) (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.

10. **Modification of the Service and of the Terms.**

Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast’s servers, or use of the Services, after 30 days, will constitute your acceptance thereof.

11. **Limitation of Liability.**

**In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.**

Except with regard to Quantcast’s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast’s negligence, or Quantcast’s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).

12. **Miscellaneous.**

This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties’ relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties’ rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast. **This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California.** This Agreement is drafted in the English language. Any translation into another language is provided for convenience only. In the event of any inconsistency between the English language version and any translation, the English language version shall prevail.

**Key Terms**
=============

Capitalized terms that are not defined in these Key Terms are as defined in the [Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy). These Key Terms are for use in understanding the Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy. Nothing in these Key Terms modifies any active agreement with any Quantcast customer, vendor or other business partner (e.g., agreements for the Advertise and Measure product, etc.).

### Advertising Exchange

See [Exchange/Advertising Exchange](#_44sinio).

### Attributes/Attribute Information

Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q). Quantcast associates attributes with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227).

### Audience

An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an [Interest](#_3as4poj), such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an [Attribute](#_1fob9te), such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client’s advertisement.

### Audience Insights

Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an [Audience](#_3znysh7). Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not [Personal Information](#_32hioqz). An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.

Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferred Data](#_qsh70q) to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.

### Bid Request/Bid Request Data

A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an [Advertising Exchange](#_30j0zll). This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard ([https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/)), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227)s (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (e.g.., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as [TCF Signals](#_1y810tw). Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.

### Browsing Data

Browsing Data is information collected relating to your [Online](#_147n2zr) activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a [Pixels, Tags, or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website [URL](#_1mrcu09) of the page you are visiting, often along with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227), as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from [HTTP Header Information](#_z337ya), such as referral [URLs](#_1mrcu09) (which is the [URL](#_1mrcu09) that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).

Browsing Data is included in [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv).

### Client Data

Client Data is [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is [Pseudonymised Information,](#_3fwokq0) which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’ [Online Data](#_147n2zr) or [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd), or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right [Audiences](#_3znysh7) and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.

### Cookie

A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0); in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) to you as an individual, and we prohibit our service providers/processors to whom we disclose [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) or [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0) from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.

There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.

A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) incorporates Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) in the context of your visits to that site.

A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) and a Quantcast [Pixel, Tag or SDK](#_1hmsyys) on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys). Quantcast uses

[Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.

Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.

### Cookie ID/Identifier

A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a [Cookie](#_4d34og8) that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227). A [First Party Cookie](#_2jxsxqh) ID is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) relating to the [First-Party Cookie](#_2jxsxqh) set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A [Third Party Cookie ID](#_28h4qwu) is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) relating to the [Third-Party Cookie](#_28h4qwu) set by Quantcast.

### Cookie Syncing/Matching

In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) can determine which of their respective [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective [Pseudonymous identifiers](#_vx1227) may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.

Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) (this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227).

The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing [Attributes](#_1fob9te) related to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched [Pseudonymous Identifier.](#_vx1227)

### Cross-Media Matching/Linking

In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or [Inferred](#_qsh70q) to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.

If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.

### Data Management Platforms and Data Providers

Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n) to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party [Audience](#_3znysh7) [Segment Data](#_1v1yuxt) from different sources (such as [Online Data](#_147n2zr) and [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd)) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions..

### Device Configuration/Device Information

Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227). The information includes device type and version, screen size and resolution, browser language, device operating system and version, browser type and version, application and version, or other information about the device. Some Device Information is derived from [HTTP Request Header Information](#_z337ya).

### Device ID/Identifier

A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as [Cookies](#_4d34og8) and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227).

A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices

### Email Address

See Hashed Email Address

### Event Data

Information collected relating to your [Online](#_147n2zr) activity/behaviour, which may include [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) in [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), [Imprecise/Approximate Location Information](#_3whwml4), [HTTP Request Header Information](#_z337ya), [Device Information](#_35nkun2), [Browsing Data](#_3dy6vkm) and [TCF Signals](#_46r0co2). Event Data is generated when a [Pixel, Tag, or SDK](#_1hmsyys) installed on a Quantcast Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a [Tag](#_2u6wntf).

### Exchange/Advertising Exchange

A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.

### First Party Cookie

See [Cookie](#_4d34og8).

### Hashed Email Address

A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_n270so602c2d).

### HTTP Request Header Information

HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a [Pixel](#_1hmsyys) loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a [Bid Request](#_tyjcwt). We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:

* [IP Address](#_1pxezwc)
* [Cookie](#_4d34og8) (if available)
* User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) that includes [Device Information](#_35nkun2).
* Date, which includes the precise time of access
* Referral [URL](#_1mrcu09), which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
* TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
* Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content

Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.

### IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)

The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data [Processing](#_2grqrue) by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that [Processing](#_2grqrue).

The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.

The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:

(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue) of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), the specific purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), and Quantcast's legal basis for such [Processing](#_2grqrue), directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;

(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of [Cookies](#_4d34og8), and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue), which are the reasons why Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) the personal data of users (“[TCF Purposes”](#_3tbugp1)), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such [Processing](#_2grqrue) directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;

(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue) of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.

Using the [TCF](#_19c6y18) allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the [TCF's](#_19c6y18) “[Global Vendor List](https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/)”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy [URL](#_1mrcu09), the purposes for which it [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.

In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) and/or any purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).

TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast [Tags](#_2u6wntf) if the digital property on which the [Tag](#_2u6wntf) is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) it receives from [Advertising Exchanges](#_2lwamvv). Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

### Imported Data

Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#_3fwokq0), which may include information relating to your [Online data](#_147n2zr) or [Offline data](#_23ckvvd) or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n).

### Imported Data (Client)

See [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf).

### Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)

See [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n).

### Imprecise/Approximate Location Information

Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.

Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems in accordance with the retention periods stated in our [Products and Services Privacy Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy).

Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc).

### Inferences/Inferred Data

Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), or [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n). Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) as part of a set of device [Attributes](#_1fob9te).

For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as [Interests](#_3as4poj), income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.

Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an [Audience](#_3znysh7).

### Interests

Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q).

### IP Address

An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.

### Labels/Label Data

Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work,” family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.

Labels processed by Quantcast are:

* Labels from [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#_26in1rg) : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227);
* Custom-[Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
* [Inferred Data](#_qsh70q) Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227), e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.

Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q)) or may be [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) (see [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) and [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n)).

### Log Data

Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our [Processing](#_2grqrue), we use more precise terms, such as [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and/or [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q), which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data.” Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), will not qualify as [Personal Information](#_32hioqz). For example, a single time zone and publisher [URL](#_1mrcu09) without an associated [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) would not qualify as [Personal Information](#_32hioqz).

### Online Data

Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.

### Offline Data

Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.

### Panel

A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.

This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.

Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.

### Personal Information

Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”

The Personal Information [Processed](#_2grqrue) by Quantcast is limited to [Pseudonymised Identifiers.](#_vx1227) Quantcast does not [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.

### Pixels, Tags, and SDKs

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive [HTTP Header Information](#_z337ya), along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:

* Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
* Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
* Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
* Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
* SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.

### Probabilistic Identifier

A Probabilistic Identifier is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) which we create by combining [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) (such as [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc)) with [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt) and/or [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using [Cookie IDs](#_2s8eyo1), this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.

### Process

Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) or sets of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

### Pseudonymous Identifiers

Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot reveal your real-life identity without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have or do. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers we hold to you as an individual, and we prohibit our service providers/processors to whom we disclose Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.

Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.

We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:

* Third Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#_2s8eyo1).
* First Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#_2s8eyo1).
* [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc).
* [Hashed email addresses](#_n4w09y2ozw7i)
* Third party identifiers
* [Device ID](#_lnxbz9).
* Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
* Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
* Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a [Bid Request](#_tyjcwt) that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
* [Probabilistic Identifier](#_41mghml).
* Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
* TLS Session ID: when you visit a website [URL](#_1mrcu09) that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.

### Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information

Pseudonymised Information is [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) that has been [Processed](#_2grqrue) in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.

### Segment Data

Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by [Clients](#_1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data Partners](#_nmf14n). Segment Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#_3fwokq0), which may include [Online Data](#_147n2zr) and/or [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd) as well as [Attributes](#_1fob9te), [Inferences](#_qsh70q), or [Interests](#_3as4poj) inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a [Label](#_49x2ik5) (in which case it is referred to as “[Label Data](#_49x2ik5)”).

### Software Development Kit (SDK)

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#_1hmsyys).

### Tag

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#_1hmsyys).

### TCF

See [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#_1y810tw).

### TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature

The [TCF](#_19c6y18) has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the [TCF](#_19c6y18). This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.

Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the [TCF](#_19c6y18) to establish the legal basis to [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) governed by the GDPR, and use the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

For detailed descriptions of TCF Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features, see [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#_1y810tw).

### Third Party Cookie/Cookie ID

See [Cookie](#_4d34og8).

### Third Party Data

Third Party Data is [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#_26in1rg). Third Party Data may include [Segment Data](#_1v1yuxt).

### Training Data

Training Data is [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0) that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual [Attributes](#_1fob9te) or [Interests](#_3as4poj) of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various [Interests](#_3as4poj) and [Attributes](#_1fob9te), such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make [Inferences](#_qsh70q). When our systems subsequently receive [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) relating to a user, we can infer whether the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely [Attributes](#_1fob9te) and [Interests](#_3as4poj) of the user to whom the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) relates. These [Inferences](#_qsh70q) are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as [www.quantcast.com](http://www.quantcast.com/); in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an [IP Address](#_1pxezwc).

**Key Terms**
=============

Effective: March 25 2025

Capitalized terms that are not defined in these Key Terms are as defined in the [Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy). These Key Terms are for use in understanding the Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy. Nothing in these Key Terms modifies any active agreement with any Quantcast customer, vendor or other business partner (e.g., agreements for the Advertise and Measure product, etc.).

### Advertising Exchange

See [Exchange/Advertising Exchange](#_44sinio).

### Attributes/Attribute Information

Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q). Quantcast associates attributes with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227).

### Audience

An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an [Interest](#_3as4poj), such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an [Attribute](#_1fob9te), such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client’s advertisement.

### Audience Insights

Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an [Audience](#_3znysh7). Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not [Personal Information](#_32hioqz). An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.

Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferred Data](#_qsh70q) to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.

### Bid Request/Bid Request Data

A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an [Advertising Exchange](#_30j0zll). This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard ([https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/)), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227)s (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (e.g.., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as [TCF Signals](#_1y810tw). Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.

### Browsing Data

Browsing Data is information collected relating to your [Online](#_147n2zr) activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a [Pixels, Tags, or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website [URL](#_1mrcu09) of the page you are visiting, often along with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227), as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from [HTTP Header Information](#_z337ya), such as referral [URLs](#_1mrcu09) (which is the [URL](#_1mrcu09) that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).

Browsing Data is included in [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv).

### Client Data

Client Data is [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is [Pseudonymised Information,](#_3fwokq0) which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’ [Online Data](#_147n2zr) or [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd), or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right [Audiences](#_3znysh7) and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.

### Cookie

A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0); in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) or [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0) from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.

There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.

A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) incorporates Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) in the context of your visits to that site.

A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) and a Quantcast [Pixel, Tag or SDK](#_1hmsyys) on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys). Quantcast uses

[Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.

Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.

### Cookie ID/Identifier

A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a [Cookie](#_4d34og8) that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227). A [First Party Cookie](#_2jxsxqh) ID is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) relating to the [First-Party Cookie](#_2jxsxqh) set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A [Third Party Cookie ID](#_28h4qwu) is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) relating to the [Third-Party Cookie](#_28h4qwu) set by Quantcast.

### Cookie Syncing/Matching

In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) can determine which of their respective [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective [Pseudonymous identifiers](#_vx1227) may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.

Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) (this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227).

The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing [Attributes](#_1fob9te) related to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched [Pseudonymous Identifier.](#_vx1227)

### Cross-Media Matching/Linking

In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or [Inferred](#_qsh70q) to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.

If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.

### Data Management Platforms and Data Providers

Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n) to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party [Audience](#_3znysh7) [Segment Data](#_1v1yuxt) from different sources (such as [Online Data](#_147n2zr) and [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd)) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) with [Data Management Platforms/Data Providers](#_26in1rg) in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see [Cookie Syncing/Matching](#_17dp8vu)).

### Device ID/Identifier

A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as [Cookies](#_4d34og8) and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227).

A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.

### Device Configuration/Device Information

Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227). The information includes device type and version, screen size and resolution, browser language, device operating system and version, browser type and version, application and version, or other information about the device. Some Device Information is derived from [HTTP Request Header Information](#_z337ya).

### Email Address

See Hashed Email Address

### Event Data

Information collected relating to your [Online](#_147n2zr) activity/behaviour, which may include [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) in [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), [Imprecise/Approximate Location Information](#_3whwml4), [HTTP Request Header Information](#_z337ya), [Device Information](#_35nkun2), [Browsing Data](#_3dy6vkm) and [TCF Signals](#_46r0co2). Event Data is generated when a [Pixel, Tag, or SDK](#_1hmsyys) installed on a Quantcast Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a [Tag](#_2u6wntf).

### Exchange/Advertising Exchange

A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.

### First Party Cookie

See [Cookie](#_4d34og8).

### Hashed Email Address

A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_n270so602c2d).

### HTTP Request Header Information

HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a [Pixel](#_1hmsyys) loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a [Bid Request](#_tyjcwt). We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:

* [IP Address](#_1pxezwc)
* [Cookie](#_4d34og8) (if available)
* User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) that includes [Device Information](#_35nkun2).
* Date, which includes the precise time of access
* Referral [URL](#_1mrcu09), which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
* TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
* Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content

Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.

### IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)

The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data [Processing](#_2grqrue) by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that [Processing](#_2grqrue).

The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.

The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:

(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue) of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), the specific purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), and Quantcast's legal basis for such [Processing](#_2grqrue), directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;

(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of [Cookies](#_4d34og8), and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue), which are the reasons why Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) the personal data of users (“[TCF Purposes”](#_3tbugp1)), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such [Processing](#_2grqrue) directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;

(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue) of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.

Using the [TCF](#_19c6y18) allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the [TCF's](#_19c6y18) “[Global Vendor List](https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/)”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy [URL](#_1mrcu09), the purposes for which it [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.

In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) and/or any purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).

TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast [Tags](#_2u6wntf) if the digital property on which the [Tag](#_2u6wntf) is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) it receives from [Advertising Exchanges](#_2lwamvv). Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Read more about the TCF here [https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/)

### Imported Data

Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#_3fwokq0), which may include information relating to your [Online data](#_147n2zr) or [Offline data](#_23ckvvd) or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n).

### Imported Data (Client)

See [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf).

### Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)

See [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n).

### Imprecise/Approximate Location Information

Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.

Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.

Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc).

### Inferences/Inferred Data

Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), or [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n). Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) as part of a set of device [Attributes](#_1fob9te).

For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as [Interests](#_3as4poj), income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.

Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an [Audience](#_3znysh7).

### Interests

Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q).

### IP Address

An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.

### Labels/Label Data

Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work,” family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.

Labels processed by Quantcast are:

* Labels from [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#_26in1rg) : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227);
* Custom-[Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
* [Inferred Data](#_qsh70q) Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227), e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.

Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q)) or may be [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) (see [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) and [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n)).

### Log Data

Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our [Processing](#_2grqrue), we use more precise terms, such as [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and/or [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q), which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data.” Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), will not qualify as [Personal Information](#_32hioqz). For example, a single time zone and publisher [URL](#_1mrcu09) without an associated [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) would not qualify as [Personal Information](#_32hioqz).

### Online Data

Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.

### Offline Data

Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.

### Panel

A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.

This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.

Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.

### Personal Information

Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”

The Personal Information [Processed](#_2grqrue) by Quantcast is limited to [Pseudonymised Identifiers.](#_vx1227) Quantcast does not [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.

### Pixels, Tags, and SDKs

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive [HTTP Header Information](#_z337ya), along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:

* Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
* Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
* Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
* Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
* SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.

### Probabilistic Identifier

A Probabilistic Identifier is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) which we create by combining [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) (such as [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc)) with [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt) and/or [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using [Cookie IDs](#_2s8eyo1), this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.

### Process

Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) or sets of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

### Pseudonymous Identifiers

Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot reveal your real-life identy without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have or do. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers we hold to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.

Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.

We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:

* Third Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#_2s8eyo1).
* First Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#_2s8eyo1).
* [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc).
* [Hashed email addresses](#_n4w09y2ozw7i)
* Third party identifiers
* [Device ID](#_lnxbz9).
* Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
* Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
* Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a [Bid Request](#_tyjcwt) that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
* [Probabilistic Identifier](#_41mghml).
* Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
* TLS Session ID: when you visit a website [URL](#_1mrcu09) that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.

### Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information

Pseudonymised Information is [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) that has been [Processed](#_2grqrue) in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.

### Segment Data

Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by [Clients](#_1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data Partners](#_nmf14n). Segment Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#_3fwokq0), which may include [Online Data](#_147n2zr) and/or [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd) as well as [Attributes](#_1fob9te), [Inferences](#_qsh70q), or [Interests](#_3as4poj) inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a [Label](#_49x2ik5) (in which case it is referred to as “[Label Data](#_49x2ik5)”).

### Software Development Kit (SDK)

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#_1hmsyys).

### Tag

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#_1hmsyys).

### TCF

See [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#_1y810tw).

### TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature

The [TCF](#_19c6y18) has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the [TCF](#_19c6y18). This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.

Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the [TCF](#_19c6y18) to establish the legal basis to [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) governed by the GDPR, and use the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

For detailed descriptions of TCF Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features, see [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#_1y810tw).

### Third Party Cookie/Cookie ID

See [Cookie](#_4d34og8).

### Third Party Data

Third Party Data is [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#_26in1rg). Third Party Data may include [Segment Data](#_1v1yuxt).

### Training Data

Training Data is [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0) that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual [Attributes](#_1fob9te) or [Interests](#_3as4poj) of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various [Interests](#_3as4poj) and [Attributes](#_1fob9te), such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make [Inferences](#_qsh70q). When our systems subsequently receive [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) relating to a user, we can infer whether the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely [Attributes](#_1fob9te) and [Interests](#_3as4poj) of the user to whom the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) relates. These [Inferences](#_qsh70q) are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as [www.quantcast.com](http://www.quantcast.com/); in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an [IP Address](#_1pxezwc).

**Key Terms**
=============

Effective: December 15 2024

Capitalized terms that are not defined in these Key Terms are as defined in the [Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy). These Key Terms are for use in understanding the Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy. Nothing in these Key Terms modifies any active agreement with any Quantcast customer, vendor or other business partner (e.g., agreements for the Advertise and Measure product, etc.).

### Advertising Exchange

See [Exchange/Advertising Exchange](#_44sinio).

### Attributes/Attribute Information

Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q). Quantcast associates attributes with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227).

### Audience

An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an [Interest](#_3as4poj), such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an [Attribute](#_1fob9te), such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client’s advertisement.

### Audience Insights

Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an [Audience](#_3znysh7). Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not [Personal Information](#_32hioqz). An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.

Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferred Data](#_qsh70q) to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.

### Bid Request/Bid Request Data

A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an [Advertising Exchange](#_30j0zll). This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard ([https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/)), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227)s (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (e.g.., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as [TCF Signals](#_1y810tw). Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.

### Browsing Data

Browsing Data is information collected relating to your [Online](#_147n2zr) activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a [Pixels, Tags, or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website [URL](#_1mrcu09) of the page you are visiting, often along with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227), as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from [HTTP Header Information](#_z337ya), such as referral [URLs](#_1mrcu09) (which is the [URL](#_1mrcu09) that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).

Browsing Data is included in [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv).

### Client Data

Client Data is [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is [Pseudonymised Information,](#_3fwokq0) which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’ [Online Data](#_147n2zr) or [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd), or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right [Audiences](#_3znysh7) and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.

### Cookie

A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0); in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) or [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0) from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.

There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.

A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) incorporates Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) in the context of your visits to that site.

A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) and a Quantcast [Pixel, Tag or SDK](#_1hmsyys) on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys). Quantcast uses

[Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.

Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.

### Cookie ID/Identifier

A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a [Cookie](#_4d34og8) that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227). A [First Party Cookie](#_2jxsxqh) ID is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) relating to the [First-Party Cookie](#_2jxsxqh) set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A [Third Party Cookie ID](#_28h4qwu) is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) relating to the [Third-Party Cookie](#_28h4qwu) set by Quantcast.

### Cookie Syncing/Matching

In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) can determine which of their respective [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective [Pseudonymous identifiers](#_vx1227) may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.

Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) (this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227).

The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing [Attributes](#_1fob9te) related to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched [Pseudonymous Identifier.](#_vx1227)

### Cross-Media Matching/Linking

In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or [Inferred](#_qsh70q) to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.

If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.

### Data Management Platforms and Data Providers

Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n) to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party [Audience](#_3znysh7) [Segment Data](#_1v1yuxt) from different sources (such as [Online Data](#_147n2zr) and [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd)) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) with [Data Management Platforms/Data Providers](#_26in1rg) in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see [Cookie Syncing/Matching](#_17dp8vu)).

### Device ID/Identifier

A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as [Cookies](#_4d34og8) and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227).

A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.

### Device Configuration/Device Information

Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227). The information includes device type and version, screen size and resolution, browser language, device operating system and version, browser type and version, application and version, or other information about the device. Some Device Information is derived from [HTTP Request Header Information](#_z337ya).

### Email Address

See Hashed Email Address

### Event Data

Information collected relating to your [Online](#_147n2zr) activity/behaviour, which may include [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) in [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), [Imprecise/Approximate Location Information](#_3whwml4), [HTTP Request Header Information](#_z337ya), [Device Information](#_35nkun2), [Browsing Data](#_3dy6vkm) and [TCF Signals](#_46r0co2). Event Data is generated when a [Pixel, Tag, or SDK](#_1hmsyys) installed on a Quantcast Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a [Tag](#_2u6wntf).

### Exchange/Advertising Exchange

A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.

### First Party Cookie

See [Cookie](#_4d34og8).

### Hashed Email Address

A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_n270so602c2d).

### HTTP Request Header Information

HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a [Pixel](#_1hmsyys) loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a [Bid Request](#_tyjcwt). We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:

* [IP Address](#_1pxezwc)
* [Cookie](#_4d34og8) (if available)
* User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) that includes [Device Information](#_35nkun2).
* Date, which includes the precise time of access
* Referral [URL](#_1mrcu09), which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
* TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
* Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content

Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.

### IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)

The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data [Processing](#_2grqrue) by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that [Processing](#_2grqrue).

The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.

The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:

(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue) of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), the specific purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), and Quantcast's legal basis for such [Processing](#_2grqrue), directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;

(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of [Cookies](#_4d34og8), and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue), which are the reasons why Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) the personal data of users (“[TCF Purposes”](#_3tbugp1)), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such [Processing](#_2grqrue) directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;

(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's [Processing](#_2grqrue) of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.

Using the [TCF](#_19c6y18) allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the [TCF's](#_19c6y18) “[Global Vendor List](https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/)”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy [URL](#_1mrcu09), the purposes for which it [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.

In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s [Processing](#_2grqrue) and/or any purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).

TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast [Tags](#_2u6wntf) if the digital property on which the [Tag](#_2u6wntf) is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the [Bid Requests](#_tyjcwt) it receives from [Advertising Exchanges](#_2lwamvv). Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Read more about the TCF here [https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/)

### Imported Data

Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#_3fwokq0), which may include information relating to your [Online data](#_147n2zr) or [Offline data](#_23ckvvd) or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n).

### Imported Data (Client)

See [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf).

### Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)

See [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n).

### Imprecise/Approximate Location Information

Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.

Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.

Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc).

### Inferences/Inferred Data

Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), or [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n). Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) as part of a set of device [Attributes](#_1fob9te).

For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as [Interests](#_3as4poj), income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.

Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an [Audience](#_3znysh7).

### Interests

Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q).

### IP Address

An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.

### Labels/Label Data

Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work,” family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.

Labels processed by Quantcast are:

* Labels from [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#_26in1rg) : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227);
* Custom-[Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
* [Inferred Data](#_qsh70q) Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227), e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.

Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q)) or may be [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) (see [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf) and [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n)).

### Log Data

Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our [Processing](#_2grqrue), we use more precise terms, such as [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_nmf14n), and/or [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_qsh70q), which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data.” Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227), will not qualify as [Personal Information](#_32hioqz). For example, a single time zone and publisher [URL](#_1mrcu09) without an associated [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) would not qualify as [Personal Information](#_32hioqz).

### Online Data

Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.

### Offline Data

Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.

### Panel

A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.

This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.

Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.

### Personal Information

Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”

The Personal Information [Processed](#_2grqrue) by Quantcast is limited to [Pseudonymised Identifiers.](#_vx1227) Quantcast does not [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.

### Pixels, Tags, and SDKs

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive [HTTP Header Information](#_z337ya), along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:

* Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
* Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
* Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
* Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
* SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.

### Probabilistic Identifier

A Probabilistic Identifier is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_vx1227) which we create by combining [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_vx1227) (such as [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc)) with [Bid Request Data](#_tyjcwt) and/or [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using [Cookie IDs](#_2s8eyo1), this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.

### Process

Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) or sets of [Personal Information](#_32hioqz), whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

### Pseudonymous Identifiers

Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.

Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.

We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:

* Third Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#_2s8eyo1).
* First Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#_2s8eyo1).
* [IP Addresses](#_1pxezwc).
* [Hashed email addresses](#_n4w09y2ozw7i)
* Third party identifiers
* [Device ID](#_lnxbz9).
* Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
* Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
* Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a [Bid Request](#_tyjcwt) that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
* [Probabilistic Identifier](#_41mghml).
* Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
* TLS Session ID: when you visit a website [URL](#_1mrcu09) that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_1hmsyys) loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.

### Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information

Pseudonymised Information is [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) that has been [Processed](#_2grqrue) in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.

### Segment Data

Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by [Clients](#_1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data Partners](#_nmf14n). Segment Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#_3fwokq0), which may include [Online Data](#_147n2zr) and/or [Offline Data](#_23ckvvd) as well as [Attributes](#_1fob9te), [Inferences](#_qsh70q), or [Interests](#_3as4poj) inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a [Label](#_49x2ik5) (in which case it is referred to as “[Label Data](#_49x2ik5)”).

### Software Development Kit (SDK)

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#_1hmsyys).

### Tag

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#_1hmsyys).

### TCF

See [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#_1y810tw).

### TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature

The [TCF](#_19c6y18) has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the [TCF](#_19c6y18). This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.

Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the [TCF](#_19c6y18) to establish the legal basis to [Process](#_2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_32hioqz) governed by the GDPR, and use the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

For detailed descriptions of TCF Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features, see [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#_1y810tw).

### Third Party Cookie/Cookie ID

See [Cookie](#_4d34og8).

### Third Party Data

Third Party Data is [Imported Data](#_4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#_26in1rg). Third Party Data may include [Segment Data](#_1v1yuxt).

### Training Data

Training Data is [Pseudonymous Information](#_3fwokq0) that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual [Attributes](#_1fob9te) or [Interests](#_3as4poj) of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various [Interests](#_3as4poj) and [Attributes](#_1fob9te), such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make [Inferences](#_qsh70q). When our systems subsequently receive [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) relating to a user, we can infer whether the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely [Attributes](#_1fob9te) and [Interests](#_3as4poj) of the user to whom the [Event Data](#_1ksv4uv) relates. These [Inferences](#_qsh70q) are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as [www.quantcast.com](http://www.quantcast.com/); in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an [IP Address](#_1pxezwc).

**Key Terms**
=============

Effective: June 6 2024

Capitalized terms that are not defined in these Key Terms are as defined in the [Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy). These Key Terms are for use in understanding the Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy. Nothing in these Key Terms modifies any active agreement with any Quantcast customer, vendor or other business partner (e.g., agreements for the Advertise and Measure product, etc.).

### Advertising Exchange

See [Exchange/Advertising Exchange](#Exchange-Advertising-Exchange).

### Attributes/Attribute Information

Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from [Event Data](#Event-Data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-Request), [Client Data](#Client-Data), [Third Party Data](https://third-party-data/), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#Inferred-Data). Quantcast associates attributes with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers).

### Audience

An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an [Interest](#Interest), such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an [Attribute](#Attribute), such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client’s advertisement.

### Audience Insights

Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an [Audience](#Audience). Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not [Personal Information](#Personal-Information). An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.

Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on [Event Data](#Event-Data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-Request), [Client Data](#Client-Data), [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data), and [Inferred Data](#Inferred-Data) to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.

### Bid Request/Bid Request Data

A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an [Advertising Exchange](#Advertising-Exchange). This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard ([https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/)), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as [TCF Signals](#TCF). Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.

### Browsing Data

Browsing Data is information collected relating to your [Online](#Online-Data) activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a [Pixels, Tags, or SDKs](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website [URL](#Uniform-Resource-Locator) of the page you are visiting, often along with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers), as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from [HTTP Header Information](#Request-Header-Information), such as referral [URLs](#Uniform-Resource-Locator) (which is the [URL](#Uniform-Resource-Locator) that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).

Browsing Data is included in [Event Data](#Event-Data).

### Client Data

Client Data is [Imported Data](#Imported-Data) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is [Pseudonymised Information,](#Pseudonymised-Information) which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’ [Online Data](#Online-Data) or [Offline Data](#Offline-Data), or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right [Audiences](#Audience) and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.

### Cookie

A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are [Pseudonymous Information](#Pseudonymised-Information); in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) or [Pseudonymous Information](#Pseudonymised-Information) from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.

There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.

A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) incorporates Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) in the context of your visits to that site.

A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) and a Quantcast [Pixel, Tag or SDK](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#Pixels-Tags-SDK). Quantcast uses

[Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.

Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.

### Cookie ID/Identifier

A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a [Cookie](#Cookie) that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers). A [First Party Cookie](#First-Party-Cookie) ID is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) relating to the [First-Party Cookie](#First-Party-Cookie) set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A [Third Party Cookie ID](#Third-Party-Cookie) is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) relating to the [Third-Party Cookie](#Third-Party-Cookie) set by Quantcast.

### Cookie Syncing/Matching

In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) can determine which of their respective [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective [Pseudonymous identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.

Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) (this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers).

The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing [Attributes](#Attribute-Information) related to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched [Pseudonymous Identifier.](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers)

### Cross-Media Matching/Linking

In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or [Inferred](#Inferred-Data) to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.

If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.

### Data Management Platforms and Data Providers

Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data) to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide [Client Data](#Client-Data) to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party [Audience](#Audience) [Segment Data](#Segment-Data) from different sources (such as [Online Data](#Online-Data) and [Offline Data](#Offline-Data)) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) with [Data Management Platforms/Data Providers](#Data-Management-Platforms) in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see [Cookie Syncing/Matching](#Cookie-Syncing)).

### Device ID/Identifier

A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as [Cookies](#Cookie) and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers).

A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.

### Device Configuration/Device Information

Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers). The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a [User Agent.](#Request-Header-Information) Some Device Information is derived from [HTTP Request Header Information](#Request-Header-Information).

### Email Address

See Hashed Email Address

### Event Data

Information collected relating to your [Online](#Online-Data) activity/behaviour, which may include [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) in [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers), [Imprecise/Approximate Location Information](#Imprecise-Approximate-Location-Information), [HTTP Request Header Information](#Request-Header-Information), [Device Information](#Device-ID), [Browsing Data](#Browsing-Data) and [TCF Signals](#TCF). Event Data is generated when a [Pixel, Tag, or SDK](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) installed on a Quantcast Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a [Tag](#Pixels-Tags-SDK).

### Exchange/Advertising Exchange

A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives [Bid Requests](#Bid-Request) from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to [Bid Requests](#Bid-Request) with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.

### First Party Cookie

See [Cookie](#Cookie).

### Hashed Email Address

A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers).

### HTTP Request Header Information

HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a [Pixel](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a [Bid Request](#Bid-Request). We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:

* [IP Address](#IP-Address)
* [Cookie](#Cookie) (if available)
* User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
* Date, which includes the precise time of access
* Referral [URL](#Uniform-Resource-Locator), which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
* TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
* Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content

Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.

### IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)

The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data [Processing](#Process) by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that [Processing](#Process).

The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.

The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:

(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's [Processing](#Process) of [Personal Information](#Personal-Information), the specific purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information), and Quantcast's legal basis for such [Processing](#Process), directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;

(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of [Cookies](#Cookie), and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's [Processing](#Process), which are the reasons why Quantcast [Processes](#Process) the personal data of users (“[TCF Purposes”](#TCF)), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such [Processing](#Process) directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;

(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's [Processing](#Process) of [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.

Using the [TCF](#TCF) allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s [Processing](#Process) to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the [TCF's](#TCF) “[Global Vendor List](https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/)”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy [URL](#Uniform-Resource-Locator), the purposes for which it [Processes](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information), and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.

In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s [Processing](#Process) and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s [Processing](#Process) and/or any purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).

TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast [Tags](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) if the digital property on which the [Tag](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the [Bid Requests](#Bid-Request) it receives from [Advertising Exchanges](#Advertising-Exchange). Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only [Process](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Read more about the TCF here [https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/)

### Imported Data

Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#Pseudonymised-Information), which may include information relating to your [Online data](#Online-Data) or [Offline data](#Offline-Data) or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see [Client Data](#Client-Data) or [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data).

### Imported Data (Client)

See [Client Data](#Client-Data).

### Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)

See [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data).

### Imprecise/Approximate Location Information

Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.

Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.

Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from [IP Addresses](#IP-Address).

### Inferences/Inferred Data

Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as [Event Data](#Event-Data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-Request), [Client Data](#Client-Data), or [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data). Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) as part of a set of device [Attributes](#Attribute-Information).

For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as [Interests](#Interests), income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.

Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an [Audience](#Audience).

### Interests

Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from [Event Data](#Event-Data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-Request), [Client Data](#Client-Data), [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#Inferred-Data).

### IP Address

An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.

### Labels/Label Data

Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work,” family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.

Labels processed by Quantcast are:

* Labels from [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#Data-Management-Platforms) : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers);
* Custom-[Client Data](#Client-Data) Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
* [Inferred Data](#Inferred-Data) Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers), e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.

Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see [Inferences/Inferred Data](#Inferred-Data)) or may be [Imported Data](#Imported-Data) (see [Client Data](#Client-Data) and [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data)).

### Log Data

Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our [Processing](#Process), we use more precise terms, such as [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers), [Event Data](#Event-Data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-Request), [Client Data](#Client-Data), [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data), and/or [Inferences/Inferred Data](#Inferred-Data), which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data.” Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers), will not qualify as [Personal Information](#Personal-Information). For example, a single time zone and publisher [URL](#Uniform-Resource-Locator) without an associated [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) would not qualify as [Personal Information](#Personal-Information).

### Online Data

Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.

### Offline Data

Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.

### Panel

A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.

This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.

Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.

### Personal Information

Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”

The Personal Information [Processed](#Process) by Quantcast is limited to [Pseudonymised Identifiers](#Probabilistic-Identifier) Quantcast does not [Process](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.

### Pixels, Tags, and SDKs

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive [HTTP Header Information](#Request-Header-Information), along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:

* Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
* Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
* Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
* Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
* SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.

### Probabilistic Identifier

A Probabilistic Identifier is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) which we create by combining [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) (such as [IP Addresses](#IP-Address)) with [Bid Request Data](#Bid-Request) and/or [Event Data](#Event-Data) using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using [Cookie IDs](#Cookie-ID), this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.

### Process

Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) or sets of [Personal Information](#Personal-Information), whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

### Pseudonymous Identifiers

Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.

Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.

We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:

* Third Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#Cookie-ID).
* First Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#Cookie-ID).
* [IP Addresses](#IP-Address).
* [Hashed email addresses](#Email-Address)
* Third party identifiers
* [Device ID](#Device-ID).
* Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
* Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
* Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a [Bid Request](#Bid-Request) that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
* [Probabilistic Identifier](#Probabilistic-Identifier).
* Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
* TLS Session ID: when you visit a website [URL](#Uniform-Resource-Locator) that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#Pixels-Tags-SDK) loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.

### Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information

Pseudonymised Information is [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) that has been [Processed](#Process) in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.

### Segment Data

Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by [Clients](#Client-Data) or [Third Party Data Partners](#Data-Management-Platforms). Segment Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#Pseudonymised-Information), which may include [Online Data](#Online-Data) and/or [Offline Data](#Offline-Data) as well as [Attributes](#Attribute-Information), [Inferences](#Inferred-Data), or [Interests](#Interests) inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a [Label](#Label-Data) (in which case it is referred to as “[Label Data](#Label-Data)”).

### Software Development Kit (SDK)

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#Pixels-Tags-SDK).

### Tag

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#Pixels-Tags-SDK).

### TCF

See [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#IAB-Transparency-Consent-Framework).

### TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature

The [TCF](#TCF) has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the [TCF](#TCF). This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.

Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the [TCF](#TCF) to establish the legal basis to [Process](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) governed by the GDPR, and use the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

For detailed descriptions of TCF Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features, see [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#IAB-Transparency-Consent-Framework).

### Third Party Cookie/Cookie ID

See [Cookie](#Cookie).

### Third Party Data

Third Party Data is [Imported Data](#Imported-Data) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#Data-Management-Platforms). Third Party Data may include [Segment Data](#Segment-Data).

### Training Data

Training Data is [Pseudonymous Information](#Pseudonymised-Information) that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual [Attributes](#Attribute-Information) or [Interests](#Interests) of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various [Interests](#Interests) and [Attributes](#Attribute-Information), such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make [Inferences](#Inferred-Data). When our systems subsequently receive [Event Data](#Event-Data) relating to a user, we can infer whether the [Event Data](#Event-Data) displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the [Event Data](#Event-Data) displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely [Attributes](#Attribute-Information) and [Interests](#Interests) of the user to whom the [Event Data](#Event-Data) relates. These [Inferences](#Inferred-Data) are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as [www.quantcast.com](http://www.quantcast.com/); in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an [IP Address](#IP-Address).

### Advertising Exchange

See [Exchange/Advertising Exchange](#Exchange-Advertising-Exchange).

### Attributes/Attribute Information

Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from [Event Data](#Event-Data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-Request), [Client Data](#Client-Data), [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#Inferences-Inferred-Data). Quantcast associates attributes with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers).

### Audience

An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an [Interest](#Interest), such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an [Attribute](#Attribute), such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.

### Audience Insights

Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an [Audience](#Audience). Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not [Personal Information](#Personal-Information). An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.

Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on [Event Data](#Event-data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-Request), [Client Data](#Client-data), [Third Party Data](#Third-party-data), and Inferred Data to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.

### Bid Request/Bid Request Data

A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an [Advertising Exchange](#Advertising-Exchange). This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard ([https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/)), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as [TCF Signals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1y810tw). Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.

### Browsing Data

Browsing Data is information collected relating to your [Online](#Online) activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a [Pixels, Tags, or SDKs](#Pixels-Tags) installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website [URL](#URL) of the page you are visiting, often along with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier), as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from [HTTP Header Information](#HTTP-Header-Information), such as referral [URLs](#URLs) (which is the [URL](#URL) that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).

Browsing Data is included in [Event Data](#Event-Data).

### Client Data

Client Data is [Imported Data](#Imported-Data) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is [Pseudonymised Information,](#Pseudonymised-Information) which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’ [Online Data](#Online-Data) or [Offline Data](#Offline-Data), or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right [Audiences](#Audiences) on behalf of the Client.

### Cookie

A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are [Pseudonymous Information](#Pseudonymous-Information); in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) or [Pseudonymous Information](#Pseudonymous-Information) from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.

There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.

A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) incorporates Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#Pixels-tags) into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) in the context of your visits to that site.

A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) and a Quantcast [Pixel, Tag or SDK](#Pixels-tags) on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#Pixels-tags). Quantcast uses

[Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.

Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.

### Cookie ID/Identifier

A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a [Cookie](#Cookie) that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers). A [First Party Cookie](#First-Party) ID is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) relating to the [First-Party Cookie](#First-Party) set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A [Third Party Cookie ID](#Third-Party-Cookie-ID) is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) relating to the [Third-Party Cookie](#Third-Party-Cookie) set by Quantcast.

### Cookie Syncing/Matching

In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) can determine which of their respective [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective [Pseudonymous identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.

Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#Pixels-Tags) from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) (this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier).

The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing [Attributes](#Attributes) related to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched [Pseudonymous Identifier.](#Pseudonymous-Identifier)

### Cross-Media Matching/Linking

In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or [Inferred](#Inferred) to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.

If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.

### Data Management Platforms and Data Providers

Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide [Third Party Data](#Third-Party-Data) to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide [Client Data](#Client-data) to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party [Audience Segment Data](#Audience-Segment-Data) [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1v1yuxt)from different sources (such as [Online Data](#Online-Data) and [Offline Data](#Offline-Data)) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) with [Data Management Platforms/Data Providers](#Data-Management-Platforms) in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see [Cookie Syncing/Matching](#Cookie-Syncing)).

### Device ID/Identifier

A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as [Cookies](#Cookies) and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier).

A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.

### Device Configuration/Device Information

Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier). The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a [User Agent.](#User-Agent) Some Device Information is derived from [HTTP Request Header Information](#HTTP-Request-Header-Information).

### Event Data

Information collected relating to your [Online](#Online) activity/behaviour, which may include [Personal Information](#Personal-information) in [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers), [Imprecise/Approximate Location Information](#Imprecise-Approximate-Location), [HTTP Request Header Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.z337ya), [Device Information](#Device-Information), [Browsing Data](#Browsing-Data) and [TCF Signals](#TCF-Signals). Event Data is generated when a [Pixel, Tag, or SDK](#Pixels-tags) installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a [Tag](#Tag).

### Exchange/Advertising Exchange

A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives Bid Requests from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to [Bid Requests](#Bid-Requests) with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.

### First Party Cookie

See [Cookie](#Cookie).

### HTTP Request Header Information

HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a [Pixel](#Pixels-tags) loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a [Bid Request](#Bid-Request). We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:

* [IP Address](#IP-address)
    
* [Cookie](#Cookie) (if available)
    
* User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
    
* Date, which includes the precise time of access
    
* Referral [URL](#URL), which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
    
* TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
    
* Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
    

Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.

### IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)

The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data [Processing](#Processing) by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that [Processing](#Processing).

The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.

The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:

(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's [Processing](#Processing) of Personal Information, the specific purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information), and Quantcast's legal basis for such [Processing](#Processing), directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;

(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of [Cookies](#Cookies), and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's [Processing](#Processing), which are the reasons why Quantcast [Processes](#Processes) the personal data of users (“[TCF Purposes”](#TCF-purpose)), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such [Processing](#Processing) directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;

(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's [Processing](#Processing) of [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.

Using the [TCF](#TCF) allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s [Processing](#Processing) to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the [TCF's](#TCF) “[Global Vendor List](https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/)”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy [URL](#URL), the purposes for which it [Processes](#Processes) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information), and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.

In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s Processing and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s Processing and/or any purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#Processes) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).

TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast [Tags](#Tag) if the digital property on which the [Tag](#Tag) is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the [Bid Requests](#Bid-request) it receives from [Advertising Exchanges](#Advertising-exchange). Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only [Process](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-information) for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Read more about the TCF here [https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/)

### Imported Data

Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#Pseudonymised-Information), which may include information relating to your [Online data](#Online-data) or [Offline data](#Offline-data) or other information that Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see [Client Data](#Client-data) or [Third Party Data](#Third-party-data).

### Imported Data (Client)

See [Client Data](#Client-data).

### Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)

See [Third Party Data](#Third-party-data).

### Imprecise/Approximate Location Information

Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.

Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.

Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from [IP Addresses](#IP-address).

### Inferences/Inferred Data

Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as [Event Data](#Event-data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-request-data), [Client Data](#Client-data), or [Third Party Data](#Third-party-data). Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) as part of a set of device [Attributes](#Attributes).

For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as [Interests](#Interests), income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.

Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an [Audience](#Audience).

### Interests

Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with Pseudonymous Identifiers to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from [Event Data](#Event-data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-request), [Client Data](#Client-data), [Third Party Data](#Third-party-data), and Inferences/Inferred Data.

### IP Address

An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.

An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://pseudonymous-identifier/).

### Labels/Label Data

Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.

Labels processed by Quantcast are:

* Labels from [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](https://data-management-platforms/) : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier);
    
* Custom-[Client Data](#Client-data) Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
    
* [Inferred Data](#Inferred-Data) Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227), e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
    

Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see [Inferences/Inferred Data](#Inferences)) or may be [Imported Data](#Imported-data) (see [Client Data](#Client-data) and [Third Party Data](#Third-party-data)).

### Log Data

Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our [Processing](#Process), we use more precise terms, such as Pseudonymous Identifiers, [Event Data](#Event-data), [Bid Request Data](#Bid-request-data), [Client Data](#Client-data), [Third Party Data](#Third-party-data), and/or Inferences/Inferred Data, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers), will not qualify as Personal Information. For example, a single time zone and publisher [URL](#URL) without an associated [Pseudonymous Identifier](#Pseudonymous-Identifier) would not qualify as [Personal Information](#Personal-information).

### Online Data

Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.

### Offline Data

Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.

### Panel

A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.

This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.

Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.

### Personal Information

Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”

The Personal Information [Processed](#Process) by Quantcast is limited to Pseudonymised Identifiers. Quantcast does not [Process](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-information) that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.

### Pixels, Tags, and SDKs

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive [HTTP Header Information](#HTTP-header-information), along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:

Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.

* Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
    
* Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
    
* Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
    
* SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
    

### Probabilistic Identifier

A Probabilistic Identifier is a Pseudonymous Identifier which we create by combining [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#Pseudonymous-Identifiers) (such as IP Addresses) with Bid Request Data and/or Event Data using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using Cookie IDs, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.

### Process

Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon Personal Information or sets of [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz), whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

### Pseudonymous Identifiers

Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.

Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.

We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:

  

* Third Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#Cookie-ID).
    
* First Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#Cookie-ID).
    
* [IP Addresses](#IP-Address).
    
* Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
    
* Third party identifiers
    
* [Device ID](#Device-ID).
    
* Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
    
* Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
    
* Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a [Bid Request](#Bid-request) that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
    
* [Probabilistic Identifier](#Probabilistic-Identifier).
    
* Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
    
* TLS Session ID: when you visit a website [URL](#URL) that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#Pixels-tags) loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
    

### Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information

Pseudonymised Information is [Personal Information](#Personal-information) that has been [Processed](#Processed) in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.

### Segment Data

Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by Clients or Third Party Data Partners. Segment Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#Pseudonymised-Information), which may include [Online Data](#Online-data) and/or [Offline Data](#Offline-data) as well as [Attributes](#Attributes), Inferences, or [Interests](#Interests) inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a Label (in which case it is referred to as “[Label Data](#Label-data)”).

### Software Development Kit (SDK)

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#Pixels-tags).

### Tag

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#Pixels-tags).

### TCF

See [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#IAB-transparency).

### TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose

  

The [TCF](#TCF) has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the [TCF](#TCF). This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.

Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the [TCF](#TCF) to establish the legal basis to [Process](#Process) [Personal Information](#Personal-Information) and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

For detailed descriptions of TCF “Purpose” or TCF “Special Purpose”, see [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1y810tw).

### Third Party Cookie/Cookie ID

See [Cookie](#Cookie).

### Third Party Data

Third Party Data is [Imported Data](#Imported-data) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#Data-management-platforms). Third Party Data may include [Segment Data](#Segment-data).

### Training Data

Training Data is [Pseudonymous Information](#Pseudonymous-Information) that we receive from Clients and third party data providers, where the actual [Attributes](#Attributes) or [Interests](#Interests) of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various [Interests](#Interests) and [Attributes](#Attributes), such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make [Inferences](#Inferences). When our systems subsequently receive [Event Data](#Event-data) relating to a user, we can infer whether the [Event Data](#Event-data) displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the [Event Data](#Event-data) displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely [Attributes](#Attributes) and [Interests](#Interests) of the user to whom the [Event Data](#Event-data) relates. These Inferences are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as [www.quantcast.com](http://www.quantcast.com/); in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an [IP Address](#IP-address).

### Attributes/Attribute Information

Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q). Quantcast associates attributes with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227).

### Audience

An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an [Interest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3as4poj), such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an [Attribute](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1fob9te), such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.

### Audience Insights

Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an [Audience](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3znysh7). Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz). An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.

Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n), and [Inferred Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q) to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.

### Bid Request/Bid Request Data

A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an [Advertising Exchange](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.30j0zll). This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard ([https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/)), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as [TCF Signals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1y810tw). Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.

### Browsing Data

Browsing Data is information collected relating to your [Online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.147n2zr) activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a [Pixels, Tags, or SDKs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys) installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website [URL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1mrcu09) of the page you are visiting, often along with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227), as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from [HTTP Header Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.z337ya), such as referral [URLs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1mrcu09) (which is the [URL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1mrcu09) that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).

Browsing Data is included in [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv).

### Client Data

Client Data is [Imported Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is [Pseudonymised Information,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0) which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’ [Online Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.147n2zr) or [Offline Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.23ckvvd), or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right [Audiences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3znysh7) on behalf of the Client.

### Cookie

A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are [Pseudonymous Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0); in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) or [Pseudonymous Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0) from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.

There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.

A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“First Party Cookie”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) incorporates Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys) into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) in the context of your visits to that site.

A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) and a Quantcast [Pixel, Tag or SDK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys) on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys). Quantcast uses

[Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.

Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.

### Cookie ID/Identifier

A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a [Cookie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.4d34og8) that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227). A [First Party Cookie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2jxsxqh) ID is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) relating to the [First-Party Cookie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2jxsxqh) set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A [Third Party Cookie ID](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.28h4qwu) is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) relating to the [Third-Party Cookie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.28h4qwu) set by Quantcast.

### Cookie Syncing/Matching

In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) can determine which of their respective [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective [Pseudonymous identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.

Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys) from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) (this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227).

The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing [Attributes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1fob9te) related to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched [Pseudonymous Identifier.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227)

### Cross-Media Matching/Linking

In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or [Inferred](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q) to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.

If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.

### Data Management Platforms and Data Providers

Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n) to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf) to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party [Audience](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3znysh7) [Segment Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1v1yuxt) from different sources (such as [Online Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.147n2zr) and [Offline Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.23ckvvd)) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) with [Data Management Platforms/Data Providers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.26in1rg) in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see [Cookie Syncing/Matching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.17dp8vu)).

### Device ID/Identifier

A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “Device IDs”) serve a similar purpose as [Cookies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.4d34og8) and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227).

A Mobile Advertising ID (or “MAID”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (“CTV”) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.

### Device Configuration/Device Information

Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227). The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a [User Agent.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3j2qqm3) Some Device Information is derived from [HTTP Request Header Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.z337ya).

### Event Data

Information collected relating to your [Online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.147n2zr) activity/behaviour, which may include [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz) in [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227), [Imprecise/Approximate Location Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3whwml4), [HTTP Request Header Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.z337ya), [Device Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.35nkun2), [Browsing Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3dy6vkm) and [TCF Signals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.46r0co2). Event Data is generated when a [Pixel, Tag, or SDK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys) installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a [Tag](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2u6wntf).

### Exchange/Advertising Exchange

A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives [Bid Requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt) from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to [Bid Requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt) with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.

### First Party Cookie

See [Cookie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.4d34og8).

### HTTP Request Header Information

HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a [Pixel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys) loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a [Bid Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt). We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:

* [IP Address](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1pxezwc)
    
* [Cookie](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.4d34og8) (if available)
    
* User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)
    
* Date, which includes the precise time of access
    
* Referral [URL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1mrcu09), which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
    
* TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
    
* Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content
    

Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.

### IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)

The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue).

The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.

The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:

(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) of [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz), the specific purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz), and Quantcast's legal basis for such [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue), directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;

(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of [Cookies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.4d34og8), and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue), which are the reasons why Quantcast [Processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) the personal data of users (“[TCF Purposes”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3tbugp1)), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;

(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) of [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz) (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.

Using the [TCF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.19c6y18) allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the [TCF's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.19c6y18) “[Global Vendor List](https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/)”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy [URL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1mrcu09), the purposes for which it [Processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz), and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.

In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) and/or any purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz) on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “TCF Signal”).

TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast [Tags](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2u6wntf) if the digital property on which the [Tag](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2u6wntf) is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“CMP”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the [Bid Requests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt) it receives from [Advertising Exchanges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2lwamvv). Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only [Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz) for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

### Imported Data

Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). Imported Data is [Pseudonymised Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0), which may include information relating to your [Online data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.147n2zr) or [Offline data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.23ckvvd) or other information that Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n).

### Imported Data (Client)

See [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf).

### Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)

See [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n).

### Imprecise/Approximate Location Information

Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.

Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.

Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from [IP Addresses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1pxezwc).

### Inferences/Inferred Data

Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf), or [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n). Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) as part of a set of device [Attributes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1fob9te).

For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as [Interests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3as4poj), income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.

Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an [Audience](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3znysh7).

### Interests

Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q).

### IP Address

An IP (“Internet Protocol”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.

An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227).

### Labels/Label Data

Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.

Labels processed by Quantcast are:

* Labels from [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.26in1rg) : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227);
    
* Custom-[Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf) Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
    
* [Inferred Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q) Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227), e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.
    

Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see [Inferences/Inferred Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q)) or may be [Imported Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.4i7ojhp) (see [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf) and [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n)).

### Log Data

Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our [Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue), we use more precise terms, such as [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227), [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n), and/or [Inferences/Inferred Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q), which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227), will not qualify as [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz). For example, a single time zone and publisher [URL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1mrcu09) without an associated [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) would not qualify as [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz).

### Online Data

Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.

### Offline Data

Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.

### Panel

A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.

This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.

Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.

### Personal Information

Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”

The Personal Information [Processed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) by Quantcast is limited to [Pseudonymised Identifiers.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) Quantcast does not [Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz) that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.

### Pixels, Tags, and SDKs

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive [HTTP Header Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.z337ya), along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:

* Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
    
* Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
    
* Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
    
* Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
    
* SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.
    

### Probabilistic Identifier

A Probabilistic Identifier is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) which we create by combining [Pseudonymous Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227) (such as [IP Addresses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1pxezwc)) with [Bid Request Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt) and/or [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv) using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using [Cookie IDs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2s8eyo1), this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.

### Process

Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz) or sets of [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz), whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

### Pseudonymous Identifiers

Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.

Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.

We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:

  

* Third Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2s8eyo1).
    
* First Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2s8eyo1).
    
* [IP Addresses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1pxezwc).
    
* Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
    
* Third party identifiers
    
* [Device ID](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.lnxbz9).
    
* Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
    
* Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
    
* Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a [Bid Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt) that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
    
* [Probabilistic Identifier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.41mghml).
    
* Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
    
* TLS Session ID: when you visit a website [URL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1mrcu09) that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys) loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.
    

### Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information

Pseudonymised Information is [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz) that has been [Processed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.

### Segment Data

Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by [Clients](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data Partners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n). Segment Data is [Pseudonymised Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0), which may include [Online Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.147n2zr) and/or [Offline Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.23ckvvd) as well as [Attributes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1fob9te), [Inferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q), or [Interests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3as4poj) inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a [Label](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.49x2ik5) (in which case it is referred to as “[Label Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.49x2ik5)”).

### TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose

  

The [TCF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.19c6y18) has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the [TCF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.19c6y18). This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.

Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the [TCF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.19c6y18) to establish the legal basis to [Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz) and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

For detailed descriptions of TCF “Purpose” or TCF “Special Purpose”, see [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1y810tw).

Training Data is [Pseudonymous Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0) that we receive from Clients and third party data providers, where the actual [Attributes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1fob9te) or [Interests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3as4poj) of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various [Interests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3as4poj) and [Attributes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1fob9te), such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make [Inferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q). When our systems subsequently receive [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv) relating to a user, we can infer whether the [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv) displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv) displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely [Attributes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1fob9te) and [Interests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.3as4poj) of the user to whom the [Event Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1ksv4uv) relates. These [Inferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q) are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as [www.quantcast.com](http://www.quantcast.com/); in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an [IP Address](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1pxezwc).

Advertising Exchange
====================

See [Exchange/Advertising Exchange](#_heading=h.44sinio).

### Attributes/Attribute Information

Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Attributes may be derived from [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv), Bid Request Data, [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_heading=h.qsh70q). Quantcast associates attributes with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227).

### Audience

An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an [Interest](#_heading=h.3as4poj), such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an [Attribute](#_heading=h.1fob9te), such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client’s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client’s advertisement.

### Audience Insights

Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an [Audience](#_heading=h.3znysh7). Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz). An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.

Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n), and [Inferred Data](#_heading=h.qsh70q) to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.

### Bid Request/Bid Request Data

A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher’s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an [Advertising Exchange](#_heading=h.30j0zll). This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher’s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard ([https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/)), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as [TCF Signals](#_heading=h.1y810tw). Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast’s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.

### Browsing Data

Browsing Data is information collected relating to your [Online](#_heading=h.147n2zr) activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a [Pixels, Tags, or SDKs](#_heading=h.1hmsyys) installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website [URL](#_heading=h.1mrcu09) of the page you are visiting, often along with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227), as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from [HTTP Header Information](#_heading=h.z337ya), such as referral [URLs](#_heading=h.1mrcu09) (which is the [URL](#_heading=h.1mrcu09) that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).

Browsing Data is included in [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv).

### Client Data

Client Data is [Imported Data](#_heading=h.4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is [Pseudonymised Information,](#_heading=h.3fwokq0) which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users’ [Online Data](#_heading=h.147n2zr) or [Offline Data](#_heading=h.23ckvvd), or other characteristics or aspects of users’ relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right [Audiences](#_heading=h.3znysh7) on behalf of the Client.

### Cookie

A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients’ advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are [Pseudonymous Information](#_heading=h.3fwokq0); in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) or [Pseudonymous Information](#_heading=h.3fwokq0) from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.

There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.

A “First Party Cookie” is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (“**First Party Cookie**”). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) incorporates Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_heading=h.1hmsyys) into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) in the context of your visits to that site.

A “Third Party Cookie” is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) and a Quantcast [Pixel, Tag or SDK](#_heading=h.1hmsyys) on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_heading=h.1hmsyys). Quantcast uses

[Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.

Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy “Information Collection” section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.

### Cookie ID/Identifier

A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a [Cookie](#_heading=h.4d34og8) that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227). A [First Party Cookie](#_heading=h.2jxsxqh) ID is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) relating to the [First-Party Cookie](#_heading=h.2jxsxqh) set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A [Third Party Cookie ID](#_heading=h.28h4qwu) is a unique [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) relating to the [Third-Party Cookie](#_heading=h.28h4qwu) set by Quantcast.

### Cookie Syncing/Matching

In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) can determine which of their respective [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as “cookie ID 123.” Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as “cookie ID ABC.” Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective [Pseudonymous identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) may relate to the device that Quantcast records as “cookie ID 123”.

Quantcast’s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_heading=h.1hmsyys) from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) (this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast’s [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227).

The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing [Attributes](#_heading=h.1fob9te) related to Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched [Pseudonymous Identifier.](#_heading=h.vx1227)

### Cross-Media Matching/Linking

In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user’s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or [Inferred](#_heading=h.qsh70q) to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.

If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is“probabilistic”– in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.

### Data Management Platforms and Data Providers

Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n) to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf) to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party [Audience](#_heading=h.3znysh7) [Segment Data](#_heading=h.1v1yuxt) from different sources (such as [Online Data](#_heading=h.147n2zr) and [Offline Data](#_heading=h.23ckvvd)) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast’s use in connection with the Solutions. We share [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) with [Data Management Platforms/Data Providers](#_heading=h.26in1rg) in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see [Cookie Syncing/Matching](#_heading=h.17dp8vu)).

### Device ID/Identifier

A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device’s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or “**Device IDs**”) serve a similar purpose as [Cookies](#_heading=h.4d34og8) and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227).

A Mobile Advertising ID (or “**MAID**”) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device by the mobile device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device’s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.

### Device Configuration/Device Information

Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227). The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a [User Agent.](#_heading=h.3j2qqm3) Some Device Information is derived from [HTTP Request Header Information](#_heading=h.z337ya).

### Event Data

Information collected relating to your [Online](#_heading=h.147n2zr) activity/behaviour, which may include [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz) in [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227), [Imprecise/Approximate Location Information](#_heading=h.3whwml4), [HTTP Request Header Information](#_heading=h.z337ya), [Device Information](#_heading=h.35nkun2), [Browsing Data](#_heading=h.3dy6vkm) and [TCF Signals](#_heading=h.46r0co2). Event Data is generated when a [Pixel, Tag, or SDK](#_heading=h.1hmsyys) installed on a Client’s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a [Tag](#_heading=h.2u6wntf).

### Exchange/Advertising Exchange

A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives [Bid Requests](#_heading=h.tyjcwt) from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to [Bid Requests](#_heading=h.tyjcwt) with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.

### First Party Cookie

See [Cookie](#_heading=h.4d34og8).

### HTTP Request Header Information

HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a [Pixel](#_heading=h.1hmsyys) loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a [Bid Request](#_heading=h.tyjcwt). We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:

* [IP Address](#_heading=h.1pxezwc)
* [Cookie](#_heading=h.4d34og8) (if available)

### User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (“User Agent”)

* Date, which includes the precise time of access
* Referral [URL](#_heading=h.1mrcu09), which is the web page you were on when the request was sent
* TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server
* Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content

Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for “HTTP header information fields”.

IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (“TCF”)
--------------------------------------------

The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or “TCF,” is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue) by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue).

The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.

The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:

(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue) of [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz), the specific purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#_heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz), and Quantcast's legal basis for such [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue), directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;

(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of [Cookies](#_heading=h.4d34og8), and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue), which are the reasons why Quantcast [Processes](#_heading=h.2grqrue) the personal data of users (“[TCF Purposes”](#_heading=h.3tbugp1)), including where Quantcast relies on the user’s consent for such [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue) directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;

(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue) of [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms/#personal-information) (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.

Using the [TCF](#_heading=h.19c6y18) allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast’s [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue) to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the [TCF's](#_heading=h.19c6y18) “[Global Vendor List](https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/)”, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast’s Privacy Policy [URL](#_heading=h.1mrcu09), the purposes for which it [Processes](#_heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz), and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.

In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast’s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast’s [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue) and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast’s [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue) and/or any purposes for which Quantcast [Processes](#_heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz) on the basis of its legitimate interests (the “**TCF Signal**”).

TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast [Tags](#_heading=h.2u6wntf) if the digital property on which the [Tag](#_heading=h.2u6wntf) is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (“**CMP**”) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the [Bid Requests](#_heading=h.tyjcwt) it receives from [Advertising Exchanges](#_heading=h.2lwamvv). Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only [Process](#_heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz) for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.

Read more about the TCF here [https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/)

### Imported Data

Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (“**API**”). Imported Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#_heading=h.3fwokq0), which may include information relating to your [Online data](#_heading=h.147n2zr) or [Offline data](#_heading=h.23ckvvd) or other information that Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n).

### Imported Data (Client)

See [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf).

### Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)

See [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n).

### Imprecise/Approximate Location Information

Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.

Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.

### Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from [IP Addresses](#_heading=h.1pxezwc).

### Inferences/Inferred Data

Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf), or [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n). Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) as part of a set of device [Attributes](#_heading=h.1fob9te).

For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider’s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as [Interests](#_heading=h.3as4poj), income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.

Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an [Audience](#_heading=h.3znysh7).

### Interests

Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include “cooking” and “outdoor activities”. Interests may be derived from [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n), and [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_heading=h.qsh70q).

### IP Address

An IP (“**Internet Protocol**”) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device’s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.

An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227).

### Labels/Label Data

Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a “label” to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as “Work”, family members as “Family,” and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.

Labels processed by Quantcast are:

* Labels from [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#_heading=h.26in1rg) : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227);
* Custom-[Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf) Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).
* [Inferred Data](#_heading=h.qsh70q) Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227), e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.

Example Labels are “male” and “visited XYZ website”. Labels may be inferred information (see [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_heading=h.qsh70q)) or may be [Imported Data](#_heading=h.4i7ojhp) (see [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf) and [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n)).

### Log Data

Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our [Processing](#_heading=h.2grqrue), we use more precise terms, such as [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227), [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv), [Bid Request Data](#_heading=h.tyjcwt), [Client Data](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf), [Third Party Data](#_heading=h.nmf14n), and/or [Inferences/Inferred Data](#_heading=h.qsh70q), which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term “Log Data”. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227), will not qualify as [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz). For example, a single time zone and publisher [URL](#_heading=h.1mrcu09) without an associated [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) would not qualify as [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz).

### Online Data

### Data relating to a user’s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.

### Offline Data

Data relating to a user’s real-world purchases and/or activity.

### Panel

A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.

This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.

Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.

### Personal Information

Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term “personal information” to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as “personal data.”

The Personal Information [Processed](#_heading=h.2grqrue) by Quantcast is limited to [Pseudonymised Identifiers.](#_heading=h.vx1227) Quantcast does not [Process](#_heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz) that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.

### Pixels, Tags, and SDKs

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive [HTTP Header Information](#_heading=h.z337ya), along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.

Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:

* Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.
* Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.
* Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients’ web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.
* Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.
* SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.

### Probabilistic Identifier

A Probabilistic Identifier is a [Pseudonymous Identifier](#_heading=h.vx1227) which we create by combining [Pseudonymous Identifiers](#_heading=h.vx1227) (such as [IP Addresses](#_heading=h.1pxezwc)) with [Bid Request Data](#_heading=h.tyjcwt) and/or [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv) using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using [Cookie IDs](#_heading=h.2s8eyo1), this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.

### Process

Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz) or sets of [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz), whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

### Pseudonymous Identifiers

Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.

  

Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.

We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:

* Third Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#_heading=h.2s8eyo1).
* First Party Cookie ID: see [Cookie ID](#_heading=h.2s8eyo1).
* [IP Addresses](#_heading=h.1pxezwc).
* Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.
* [Device ID](#_heading=h.lnxbz9).
* Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.
* Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).
* Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a [Bid Request](#_heading=h.tyjcwt) that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.
* [Probabilistic Identifier](#_heading=h.41mghml).
* Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.
* TLS Session ID: when you visit a website [URL](#_heading=h.1mrcu09) that starts with “https” instead of “http”, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](#_heading=h.1hmsyys) loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.

### Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information

Pseudonymised Information is [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz) that has been [Processed](#_heading=h.2grqrue) in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.

### Segment Data

Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by [Clients](#_heading=h.1t3h5sf) or [Third Party Data Partners](#_heading=h.nmf14n). Segment Data is [Pseudonymised Information](#_heading=h.3fwokq0), which may include [Online Data](#_heading=h.147n2zr) and/or [Offline Data](#_heading=h.23ckvvd) as well as [Attributes](#_heading=h.1fob9te), [Inferences](#_heading=h.qsh70q), or [Interests](#_heading=h.3as4poj) inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called “Segment Data” because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., “auto buyers,” “shoe shoppers,” or “women 25-35”). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of “male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion”). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the “male”, “shopper”, and “sports fashion” segments). A segment may be identified with a [Label](#_heading=h.49x2ik5) (in which case it is referred to as “[Label Data](#_heading=h.49x2ik5)”).

### Software Development Kit (SDK)

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#_heading=h.1hmsyys).

### Tag

See [Pixels, Tags, and SDKs](#_heading=h.1hmsyys).

### TCF

See [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#_heading=h.1y810tw).

### TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose

The [TCF](#_heading=h.19c6y18) has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the [TCF](#_heading=h.19c6y18). This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features for each website they visit.

Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the [TCF](#_heading=h.19c6y18) to establish the legal basis to [Process](#_heading=h.2grqrue) [Personal Information](#_heading=h.32hioqz) and use the Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.

For detailed descriptions of TCF “Purpose” or TCF “Special Purpose”, see [IAB Transparency & Consent Framework](#_heading=h.1y810tw).

### Third Party Cookie/Cookie ID

See [Cookie](#_heading=h.4d34og8).

### Third Party Data

Third Party Data is [Imported Data](#_heading=h.4i7ojhp) that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party [Data Management Platforms and Data Providers](#_heading=h.26in1rg). Third Party Data may include [Segment Data](#_heading=h.1v1yuxt).

### Training Data

Training Data is [Pseudonymous Information](#_heading=h.3fwokq0) that we receive from Clients and third party data providers, where the actual [Attributes](#_heading=h.1fob9te) or [Interests](#_heading=h.3as4poj) of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various [Interests](#_heading=h.3as4poj) and [Attributes](#_heading=h.1fob9te), such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make [Inferences](#_heading=h.qsh70q). When our systems subsequently receive [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv) relating to a user, we can infer whether the [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv) displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv) displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely [Attributes](#_heading=h.1fob9te) and [Interests](#_heading=h.3as4poj) of the user to whom the [Event Data](#_heading=h.1ksv4uv) relates. These [Inferences](#_heading=h.qsh70q) are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Clients.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as [www.quantcast.com](http://www.quantcast.com/); in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an [IP Address](#_heading=h.1pxezwc).

**Last Update: May 16, 2023**

This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners is for Quantcast publisher partners and clients (“publishers”) who include Quantcast code, such as pixels or tags, on their websites for Quantcast Measure or the Quantcast QID Module in Prebid. It documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for publishers, which are in addition to the [US Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum) (the “DPA”). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPA, the DPA is the controlling document.

Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users’ rights are honored appropriately.

Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.

This document does not contain legal advice, and adherence to this document does not ensure legal compliance. Publishers must ensure for themselves that they operate in a legal manner, based on their particular circumstances. In the event of any conflict between this document and applicable laws or regulations, the laws or regulations should prevail.

Terminology

This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.

When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.

We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a publisher has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

Industry standards and self-regulatory programs

Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Publishers are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self-regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.

Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.

Unfortunately, terms used across jurisdictions that describe the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data.

Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a “controller” of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels dropped on your sites. This document, together with the Quantcast agreement under which you access our services, addresses our respective GDPR compliance responsibilities. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party” unless agreed otherwise.

Notice/Transparency and Choice

Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice – either opt in or opt out — with respect to that processing.

When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, including Quantcast Measure tags and the QID prebid module, publishers are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, publishers have to make sure of notice and choice for their own collection and processing of personal data.

At minimum, and further subject to any other applicable laws or rules, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users’ data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising and advertising measurement), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions, including the EU and the UK, would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice, and a link to Quantcast’s [privacy policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy) be included.

Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching, and cross-device matching (using passively collected data). The data Quantcast collects includes information about users’ visits to sites, such as IP address, device information, timestamp, referrer URL, etc.

Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods, and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.

For their part, publishers need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Publishers should, at minimum, and subject to any additional legal requirements provide a link to the geographically relevant industry opt-out page, including but not limited to [YourAdChoices](https://youradchoices.com/) and the [NAI](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) in the US, [Your Online Choices](https://youronlinechoices.com/) in Europe, and [Your Ad Choices](https://youradchoices.ca/) in Canada.

In all cases, publishers should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.

Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.

Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, publishers are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don’t fire until that consent is obtained. Publishers must not send to Quantcast, or enable Quantcast to collect, personal data without having established required permissions, and certainly not if the user has explicitly opted out.

**EU and the UK**: The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast’s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the publisher has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such publishers may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast’s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform. Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these TCF requirements.

Publishers not using the TCF for EU or UK users may, only with Quantcast’s express written permission, use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast’s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF. In any case, publishers should not allow data to be collected by, or transmitted to, Quantcast on their sites without user consent, and must be able to provide proof of consent to Quantcast, upon request.

Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt-out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.

**US**: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.

**California**: The CCPA applies for users in California. Publishers need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “share” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable. Unless agreed otherwise with Quantcast, Quantcast acts as a “third-party,” as defined under the CCPA, with respect to personal data it collects or receives from publishers’ sites. Quantcast will check the US Privacy String, [as specified by the IAB](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ccpa/).

**Other US states:** Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and elsewhere. Publishers need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “targeted advertising” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.

**US State Privacy Addendum**: The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US Data Privacy Addendum, [which is available here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum).

Access and Deletion

Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, when acting as a controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for honoring users’ access and deletion requests with respect to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services.

Other Matters

**Sensitive data**. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category data” under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, publishers must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law.

**Directly identifying personal data**. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and publishers may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a publisher has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

**Reidentification**. Under no circumstances will publishers use any information collected or generated by Quantcast’s services to identify an individual user.

Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Advertiser Partners

Effective August 26th 2024

This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Advertiser Partners documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for advertisers and agencies, which are in addition to the [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum) and the [International Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-data-privacy-addendum) (collectively, the “DPAs”). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPAs, the DPAs are the controlling documents.

Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users’ rights are honored appropriately.

Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.

Terminology

This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.

When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.

We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

Industry standards and self-regulatory programs

Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Partners and clients are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self- regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.

Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.

Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast’s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.

**Advertisers**: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast’s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party” in the State of California and as a “processor” or such similar designation for all other applicable US states.

Notice/Transparency and Choice

Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice – either opt in or opt out — with respect to that processing.

When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, or otherwise introducing data into Quantcast’s services, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, partners and clients have to make sure of notice and choice for their own personal data collection and processing.

Generally, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users’ data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice and a link to Quantcast’s [privacy policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy) be included.

Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching and cross-device matching (using passively collected data).

Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.

For their part, partners and clients need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Usually this means providing access to choose within other privacy disclosures, including in a privacy policy.

In all cases, partners and clients should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.

Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.

Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don’t fire until that consent is obtained.

**EU and the UK**: The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast’s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the client or partner has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such partners and clients may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast’s services.

Partners and clients not using the TCF for EU or UK users need to use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast’s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF.

Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.

**US**: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.

**California**: The CCPA applies for users in California. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “share” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.

**Other US states**: Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “targeted advertising” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.

**US State Privacy Addendum**: The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US State Privacy Addendum, [which is available here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum).

Access and Deletion

Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services, and for deleting personal data after it receives (or is notified of) a user’s request.

Other Matters

**Sensitive data**. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” under applicable law (including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or related to health status or treatment) or data about children under the age of 18 or such other age specified by applicable laws, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 18 or such other age specified by applicable laws. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law. Sensitive data also includes any data that qualifies as “consumer health data” under the Washington My Health My Data Act, 2023 Wash. Laws 191 or any other equivalent laws.

**Directly identifying personal data**. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and partners and clients may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

**Reidentification**. Under no circumstances will clients and other partners use any information collected or generated by Quantcast’s services to identify an individual user.

This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Advertiser Partners documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for advertisers and agencies, which are in addition to the [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum) and the [International Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-data-privacy-addendum) (collectively, the “DPAs”). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPAs, the DPAs are the controlling documents.

Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users’ rights are honored appropriately.

Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.

Terminology

This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.

When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.

We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

Industry standards and self-regulatory programs

Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Partners and clients are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self- regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.

Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.

Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast’s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.

Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast’s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party.”

Notice/Transparency and Choice

Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice – either opt in or opt out — with respect to that processing.

When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, or otherwise introducing data into Quantcast’s services, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, partners and clients have to make sure of notice and choice for their own personal data collection and processing.

Generally, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users’ data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice and a link to Quantcast’s [privacy policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy) be included.

Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching and cross-device matching (using passively collected data).

Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.

For their part, partners and clients need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Usually this means providing access to choose within other privacy disclosures, including in a privacy policy.

In all cases, partners and clients should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.

Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.

Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don’t fire until that consent is obtained.

EU and the UK: The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast’s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the client or partner has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such partners and clients may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast’s services.

Partners and clients not using the TCF for EU or UK users need to use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast’s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF.

Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.

US: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.

California: The CCPA applies for users in California. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “share” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.

Other US states: Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “targeted advertising” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.

US State Privacy Addendum: The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US State Privacy Addendum, [which is available here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum).

Access and Deletion

Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services, and for deleting personal data

after it receives (or is notified of) a user’s request. Other Matters

Sensitive data. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” under applicable law (including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or related to health status or treatment) or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law. Sensitive data also includes any data that qualifies as “consumer health data” under the Washington My Health My Data Act, 2023 Wash. Laws 191 or any other equivalent laws.

Directly identifying personal data. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and partners and clients may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

Reidentification. Under no circumstances will clients and other partners use any information collected or generated by Quantcast’s services to identify an individual user.

Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast’s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party.”

Notice/Transparency and Choice

Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice – either opt in or opt out — with respect to that processing.

When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, or otherwise introducing data into Quantcast’s services, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, partners and clients have to make sure of notice and choice for their own personal data collection and processing.

Generally, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users’ data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice and a link to Quantcast’s [privacy policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy) be included.

Quantcast’s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching and cross-device matching (using passively collected data).

Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.

For their part, partners and clients need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Usually this means providing access to choose within other privacy disclosures, including in a privacy policy.

In all cases, partners and clients should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.

Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.

Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don’t fire until that consent is obtained.

**EU and the UK:** The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast’s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the client or partner has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such partners and clients may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast’s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform. Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these requirements.

Partners and clients not using the TCF for EU or UK users need to use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast’s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF.

Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.

**US**: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.

**California**: The CCPA applies for users in California. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “share” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.

**Other US states**: Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their “sale” and “targeted advertising” opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.

**US State Privacy Addendum:** The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US State Privacy Addendum, [which is available here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum).

Access and Deletion

Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services, and for deleting personal data after it receives (or is notified of) a user’s request.

Other Matters

**Sensitive data**. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law.

**Directly identifying personal data**. Quantcast’s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and partners and clients may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

**Reidentification**. Under no circumstances will publishers use any information collected or generated by Quantcast’s services to identify an individual user.

**Last Update: May 16, 2023**

This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Advertiser Partners documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for advertisers and agencies, which are in addition to the [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum) and the [EEA/UK/Swiss Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#eea-uk-swiss-data-privacy-addendum) (collectively, the “DPAs”). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPAs, the DPAs are the controlling documents.

Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users’ rights are honored appropriately.

Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.

Terminology

This document uses “user” or “users” as interchangeable with “data subject” or “consumer” or other equivalent terms from various rules.

When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast’s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions’ rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.

We also will use “personal data” as interchangeable with terms such as, “personal information.” Personal data processed by Quantcast’s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.

Industry standards and self-regulatory programs

Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Partners and clients are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self-regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast’s services.

Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.

Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast’s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.

Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast’s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a “third party.”

Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast’s services.

This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user’s personal data, and a link to Quantcast’s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF.

Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.

**US State Privacy Addendum:** The processing of US users’ personal data in connection with Quantcast’s services shall be governed by the US State Privacy Addendum, [which is available here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum).

Access and Deletion

Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast’s services, and for deleting personal data after it receives (or is notified of) a user’s request.

Other Matters

**Sensitive data**. Because Quantcast’s services are not intended for processing data regarded as “sensitive” or “special category” under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16.

These IO Terms are comprised of the following:  

**(1) 4A’s/IAB Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less, Version 3 (“4As Term”)**, located [here](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IAB_4As-tsandcs-FINAL.pdf) are incorporated herein by reference; and

**(2) The** **following additional and controlling terms:**  

a_.Services_: The Services include Quantcast’s campaign management services, including campaign strategy and campaign execution and any other data services, products, features and/or tools provided by Quantcast under an IO or selected via the Platform (as defined below). Quantcast may use the Platform on Company’s behalf to provide the Services, including to (i) purchase inventory, (ii) run campaigns, (iii) build audiences (iv) select additional Services, including Third-Party Services (as defined below). Any selection made by Quantcast in the Platform on Company’s behalf shall be deemed a selection made by Company for purposes of the IO Terms.

_c. Cross-Platform_: All campaigns are served with blended devices (desktop, mobile web, tablet) targeting unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.  

_d. Payment and_ _Invoicing_:

i. Payment to be made in the currency identified in the _Campaign Total Budget_ (as shown in the IO).

ii. Quantcast will provide monthly invoices electronically.

iii. In the case of non-US placements, the Campaign Total Budget is exclusive of VAT.

iv.Section III(c) of the 4As Terms shall not apply. Company will pay invoices within 30 days of the invoice date. Quantcast reserves the right to charge interest of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments. Company will be responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs that Quantcast incurs to collect any unpaid invoices.

v. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is solely responsible for all amounts payable for Third-Party Services (defined below) and the cost of placing the AdChoices or similar icon (“**Third-Party Costs**”), whether Quantcast includes such Third-Party Costs on its invoices or Company pays such Third-Party Costs directly. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon. Company acknowledges that any Third-Party Costs shown in the Platform are based on the information Quantcast receives from the third parties and are subject to the final amounts charged by such third parties.

e_.Budget Fluidity for Performance Optimization_: Quantcast may shift budgets among placements across the entire date range of a campaign in order to optimize performance; provided, that Quantcast stays within the Campaign Total Budget.

  

f. _Privacy Requirements and Campaign Policy_

i. Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services). Without limiting the foregoing, throughout the term of the IO, the parties agree to adhere to Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self- regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). If a change in Applicable Privacy Laws or self- regulatory principles necessitates a change to these IO Terms, the parties will work together in good faith to agree to appropriate revisions. “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means all applicable international, federal, state, or local laws and regulations relating to personal data or personal information, as may be amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and any EU Member State laws implementing the GDPR, the UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “**GDPR**”), the e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) and the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (collectively, “**ePD**”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 – 1798.199), as amended, including by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”).

ii. Each party will (a) prominently display a user-friendly, easily-accessible, clear, and comprehensive privacy policy on its website or mobile application that complies with all applicable laws (including Applicable Privacy Laws) and applicable self- regulatory principles; and (b) if and as applicable, provide website or application visitors in its privacy policy (i) notice that its website, application, or service permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the data collected and the means of collection, and (iii) a link to an industry-standard opt- out mechanism, such as the [NAI](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or [DAA](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) opt out page.

iii. Company will not use the Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing campaign tags on websites, apps and/or other digital properties whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of a user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing campaign tags on websites, apps and/or other digital properties directed at children. “Direct Identifier” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID or other digital identifiers. For purposes of these IO Terms, “children” refers to anyone age 16 or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

iv. These IO Terms incorporate (i) the [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum) to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and (ii) the [International Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-data-privacy-addendum) to the extent that the Services include processing of personal data that is subject to International Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum).

[In addition, Company will comply with Quantcast’s then-current Campaign and Data Policy and](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy) [Privacy Requirements](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy) [(collectively the “**Campaign Policy**”). All of the foregoing linked adden](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy)da and policies constitute “Policies” under the 4As Terms.

  

g._Viewability_

  

i. _Viewability Calculation_: Viewability is calculated as the number of in-view impressions divided by the number of vendor-measured, delivered impressions served across the entire campaign. The percentage viewability for measured impressions will be imputed to unmeasured impressions.

ii. _Viewability Goal_: If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will optimize delivery towards the applicable Viewability Goal.

iii. _Viewability Guarantee_: If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will provide the Viewability Guarantee. Such guarantee will only be offered for video placements, Search Powered Audiences, Demographic Audiences, and Data Partner Audiences.

a. **Makegood**. If the Viewability Guarantee is not met, Company’s sole remedy will be Quantcast’s delivery, for a brand campaign, of a number of impressions equal to double the difference between the Viewability Guarantee and the actual viewability delivered. This double makegood will fulfill the stated guarantee, and is not itself subject to a viewability requirement.

b. **Conditions****.**

1.Viewability Vendor must be MRC accredited. Other than for MOAT, Company will provide Quantcast with the Viewability Vendor’s daily reporting.

2\. Company must raise any viewability dispute within 30 days of the campaign end date.

3\. Lowering the viewability requirement during a campaign voids the guarantee.

4\. Makegood impressions expire 90 days from the campaign end date.

5\. At its discretion, Quantcast may issue a credit memo for the value of makegood impressions.

iv._vCPM_: If a placement uses a vCPM pricing model, Company will only be billed for viewable (or “in-view”) impressions (regardless of the percentage of viewability) as reported by the Viewability Vendor (specified in the placement on the IO).

h_.Third-Party Ad Server_: If Company is using a third-party ad server, Company will provide Quantcast log-in access to each Ad Server listed in the placements above within 24 hours of campaign start date for reporting access (including conversions, if applicable).  

j. _Additional Company Representation and Warranty__._
======================================================

i. Company represents and warrants that it will comply with all applicable laws and has obtained all necessary licensure for performance hereunder, and that Ads will not infringe or violate any applicable laws, ordinances, rules, codes, or regulations (including, without limitation, any industry-specific ethical, professional, or self-regulatory requirements or guidelines, and Applicable Privacy Laws) or the rights of any third party. If Company is an Agency (as defined in the 4As Terms), Company also represents and warrants that it has the authority to bind its Clients to these IO Terms and each IO, and that all of Company’s actions related to these IO Terms and each IO will be within the scope of such agency.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

  

k. _For Placements Priced on a CPA basis._
==========================================

i. Company agrees to pay Quantcast for the conversions and click-thru conversions as stated within the applicable placement. The conversion is defined as from both click-thru and view-thru conversions.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================

  

I. _IAB Ads.txt Principles_: Quantcast supports the principles of IAB initiative ads.txt and recommends all publishers adopt ads.txt as soon as possible. For inventory where we crawl a non-empty ads.txt file, Quantcast will only consider buying inventory from authorized sellers.

  

m. _Advertise Platform Access_: If Quantcast provides Company with access to Quantcast’s platform (“**Platform**”), the following terms apply:

i. Quantcast may provide individuals authorized by Company (“**Authorized Users**”) with view only access to the Platform. Quantcast will set up the initial Authorized Users requested by Company. Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is required to maintain at least one Authorized User, and access credentials for that user, during the Services. Each Authorized User will have the ability to add new Authorized Users and terminate access for existing Authorized Users. Company may also request that Quantcast add additional Authorized Users (email being sufficient for such requests). Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users and all activity under its account, including maintaining the confidentiality of its account logins and passwords and shall immediately notify Quantcast in writing of any loss or involuntary disclosure thereof. Company shall ensure that all Authorized Users (a) use Company’s account solely on behalf of Company, as Company is authorized to access and use the Services under these IO Terms, and (b) are aware of, and comply with, all requirements and restrictions described in these IO Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Company shall be liable for any breach of these IO Terms by any Authorized User.

ii. Subject to these IO Terms, during the term of the IO and for any additional period permitted by Quantcast, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Platform solely to (a) view campaigns set-up in the Platform as part of the Services, and/or (b) view reports generated by the Services.

iii. Company will ensure that its account information is accurate and current. Quantcast reserves the right to review and, if needed, correct, the information and setup associated with Company’s account and Authorized Users.

iv. Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Platform security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Platform to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of Company, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, and data made available on the Platform, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Platform, or (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than Company’s own Clients who are obligated to treat such reports confidentially, if applicable).

v.For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing and improving the Services.

  

n. _Client Data_: Upon written request from an advertiser client (“**Client**”), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with their written request (including, without limitation, sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Platform). For clarity, “**Client Data**” means the (i) data Quantcast receives from campaign tag(s) placed by or on behalf of Company or its Clients on websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments that Company may have created using the tag data or any campaign performance data generated from campaigns delivered by Company using such Client Data.

  

o. _Jurisdiction and Venue._

i. **If signed by Quantcast Corp.:** All IOs will be governed by the laws of the state of California. Quantcast and Company (on behalf of itself and its Clients) agree that any claims, legal proceedings, or litigation arising in connection with the IO (including the Terms) will be brought solely and exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.

v. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is solely responsible for all amounts payable for Third-Party Services (defined below) and the cost of placing the AdChoices or similar icon (“**Third-Party Costs**”), whether Quantcast includes such Third-Party Costs on its invoices or Company pays such Third-Party Costs directly. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon. Company acknowledges that any Third-Party Costs shown in the Platform are based on the information Quantcast receives from the third parties and are subject to the final amounts charged by such third parties.

Without limiting the foregoing, throughout the term of the IO, the parties agree to adhere to Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self- regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). If a change in Applicable Privacy Laws or self- regulatory principles necessitates a change to these IO Terms, the parties will work together in good faith to agree to appropriate revisions. “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means all applicable international, federal, state, or local laws and regulations relating to personal data or personal information, as may be amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and any EU Member State laws implementing the GDPR, the UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “**GDPR**”), the e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) and the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (collectively, “**ePD**”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 – 1798.199), as amended, including by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”).

ii. Each party will (a) prominently display a user-friendly, easily-accessible, clear, and comprehensive privacy policy on its website or mobile application that complies with all applicable laws (including Applicable Privacy Laws) and applicable self- regulatory principles; and (b) if and as applicable, provide website or application visitors in its privacy policy (i) notice that its website, application, or service permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the data collected and the means of collection, and (iii) a link to an industry-standard opt- out mechanism, such as the [NAI](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or [DAA](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) opt out page.

iii. Company will not use the Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing campaign tags on websites, apps and/or other digital properties whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of a user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing campaign tags on websites, apps and/or other digital properties directed at children. “Direct Identifier” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID or other digital identifiers. For purposes of these IO Terms, “children” refers to anyone age 16 or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

iv. These IO Terms incorporate (i) the [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum) to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and (ii) the [International Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-privacy-addendum) [Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy) to the extent that the Services include processing of personal data that is subject to International Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum).

[In addition, Company will comply with Quantcast’s then-current Campaign and Data Policy and](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy) [Privacy Requirements](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy) [(collectively the “**Campaign Policy**”). All of the foregoing linked adden](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy)da and policies constitute “Policies” under the 4As Terms.

  

g._Viewability_

  

i. _Viewability Calculation_: Viewability is calculated as the number of in-view impressions divided by the number of vendor-measured, delivered impressions served across the entire campaign. The percentage viewability for measured impressions will be imputed to unmeasured impressions.

ii. _Viewability Goal_: If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will optimize delivery towards the applicable Viewability Goal.

iii. _Viewability Guarantee_: If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will provide the Viewability Guarantee. Such guarantee will only be offered for video placements, Search Powered Audiences, Demographic Audiences, and Data Partner Audiences.

a. **Makegood**. If the Viewability Guarantee is not met, Company’s sole remedy will be Quantcast’s delivery, for a brand campaign, of a number of impressions equal to double the difference between the Viewability Guarantee and the actual viewability delivered. This double makegood will fulfill the stated guarantee, and is not itself subject to a viewability requirement.

b. **Conditions****.**

1.Viewability Vendor must be MRC accredited. Other than for MOAT, Company will provide Quantcast with the Viewability Vendor’s daily reporting.

2\. Company must raise any viewability dispute within 30 days of the campaign end date.

3\. Lowering the viewability requirement during a campaign voids the guarantee.

4\. Makegood impressions expire 90 days from the campaign end date.

5\. At its discretion, Quantcast may issue a credit memo for the value of makegood impressions.

iv._vCPM_: If a placement uses a vCPM pricing model, Company will only be billed for viewable (or “in-view”) impressions (regardless of the percentage of viewability) as reported by the Viewability Vendor (specified in the placement on the IO).

h_.Third-Party Ad Server_: If Company is using a third-party ad server, Company will provide Quantcast log-in access to each Ad Server listed in the placements above within 24 hours of campaign start date for reporting access (including conversions, if applicable).  

j. _Additional Company Representation and Warranty__._

i. Company represents and warrants that it will comply with all applicable laws and has obtained all necessary licensure for performance hereunder, and that Ads will not infringe or violate any applicable laws, ordinances, rules, codes, or regulations (including, without limitation, any industry-specific ethical, professional, or self-regulatory requirements or guidelines, and Applicable Privacy Laws) or the rights of any third party. If Company is an Agency (as defined in the 4As Terms), Company also represents and warrants that it has the authority to bind its Clients to these IO Terms and each IO, and that all of Company’s actions related to these IO Terms and each IO will be within the scope of such agency.

Each Authorized User will have the ability to add new Authorized Users and terminate access for existing Authorized Users. Company may also request that Quantcast add additional Authorized Users (email being sufficient for such requests). Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users and all activity under its account, including maintaining the confidentiality of its account logins and passwords and shall immediately notify Quantcast in writing of any loss or involuntary disclosure thereof. Company shall ensure that all Authorized Users (a) use Company’s account solely on behalf of Company, as Company is authorized to access and use the Services under these IO Terms, and (b) are aware of, and comply with, all requirements and restrictions described in these IO Terms.

n. _Client Data_: Upon written request from an advertiser client (“**Client**”), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with their written request (including, without limitation, sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Platform). For clarity, “**Client Data**” means the (i) data Quantcast receives from campaign tag(s) placed by or on behalf of Company or its Clients on websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments that Company may have created using the tag data or any campaign performance data generated from campaigns delivered by Company using such Client Data.

If a change in Applicable Privacy Laws or self- regulatory principles necessitates a change to these IO Terms, the parties will work together in good faith to agree to appropriate revisions. “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means all applicable international, federal, state, or local laws and regulations relating to personal data or personal information, as may be amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and any EU Member State laws implementing the GDPR, the UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “**GDPR**”), the e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) and the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (collectively, “**ePD**”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal.

ii. Each party will (a) prominently display a user-friendly, easily-accessible, clear, and comprehensive privacy policy on its website or mobile application that complies with all applicable laws (including Applicable Privacy Laws) and applicable self- regulatory principles; and (b) if and as applicable, provide website or application visitors in its privacy policy (i) notice that its website, application, or service permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the data collected and the means of collection, and (iii) a link to an industry-standard opt- out mechanism, such as the [NAI](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or [DAA](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) opt out page.

For purposes of these IO Terms, “children” refers to anyone age 16 or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

iv. These IO Terms incorporate the [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum) to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing European Economic Area, the UK or Switzerland, these IO Terms incorporate the [International Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-privacy-addendum) [Privacy Addendum.](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy)

All of the foregoing linked adden](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy)da and policies constitute “Policies” under the 4As Terms.

  

g._Viewability_

  

i. _Viewability Calculation_: Viewability is calculated as the number of in-view impressions divided by the number of vendor-measured, delivered impressions served across the entire campaign. The percentage viewability for measured impressions will be imputed to unmeasured impressions.

ii. _Viewability Goal_: If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will optimize delivery towards the applicable Viewability Goal.

iii. _Viewability Guarantee_: If specified in the placement(s) on the insertion order, Quantcast will provide the Viewability Guarantee. Such guarantee will only be offered for video placements, Search Powered Audiences, Demographic Audiences, and Data Partner Audiences.

a. **Makegood**. If the Viewability Guarantee is not met, Company’s sole remedy will be Quantcast’s delivery, for a brand campaign, of a number of impressions equal to double the difference between the Viewability Guarantee and the actual viewability delivered. This double makegood will fulfill the stated guarantee, and is not itself subject to a viewability requirement.

b. **Conditions****.**

1.Viewability Vendor must be MRC accredited. Other than for MOAT, Company will provide Quantcast with the Viewability Vendor’s daily reporting.

2\. Company must raise any viewability dispute within 30 days of the campaign end date.

3\. Lowering the viewability requirement during a campaign voids the guarantee.

4\. Makegood impressions expire 90 days from the campaign end date.

5\. At its discretion, Quantcast may issue a credit memo for the value of makegood impressions.

iv._vCPM_: If a placement uses a vCPM pricing model, Company will only be billed for viewable (or “in-view”) impressions (regardless of the percentage of viewability) as reported by the Viewability Vendor (specified in the placement on the IO).

h_.Third-Party Ad Server_: If Company is using a third-party ad server, Company will provide Quantcast log-in access to each Ad Server listed in the placements above within 24 hours of campaign start date for reporting access (including conversions, if applicable).  

j. _Additional Company Representation and Warranty__._
======================================================

i. Company represents and warrants that it will comply with all applicable laws and has obtained all necessary licensure for performance hereunder, and that Ads will not infringe or violate any applicable laws, ordinances, rules, codes, or regulations (including, without limitation, any industry-specific ethical, professional, or self-regulatory requirements or guidelines, and Applicable Privacy Laws) or the rights of any third party. If Company is an Agency (as defined in the 4As Terms), Company also represents and warrants that it has the authority to bind its Clients to these IO Terms and each IO, and that all of Company’s actions related to these IO Terms and each IO will be within the scope of such agency.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

  

k. _For Placements Priced on a CPA basis._
==========================================

i. Company agrees to pay Quantcast for the conversions and click-thru conversions as stated within the applicable placement. The conversion is defined as from both click-thru and view-thru conversions.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================

  

I. _IAB Ads.txt Principles_: Quantcast supports the principles of IAB initiative ads.txt and recommends all publishers adopt ads.txt as soon as possible. For inventory where we crawl a non-empty ads.txt file, Quantcast will only consider buying inventory from authorized sellers.

  

m. _Advertise Platform Access_: If Quantcast provides Company with access to Quantcast’s platform (“**Platform**”), the following terms apply:

i. Quantcast may provide individuals authorized by Company (“**Authorized Users**”) with view only access to the Platform. Quantcast will set up the initial Authorized Users requested by Company. Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is required to maintain at least one Authorized User, and access credentials for that user, during the Services. Each Authorized User will have the ability to add new Authorized Users and terminate access for existing Authorized Users. Company may also request that Quantcast add additional Authorized Users (email being sufficient for such requests). Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users and all activity under its account, including maintaining the confidentiality of its account logins and passwords and shall immediately notify Quantcast in writing of any loss or involuntary disclosure thereof. Company shall ensure that all Authorized Users (a) use Company’s account solely on behalf of Company, as Company is authorized to access and use the Services under these IO Terms, and (b) are aware of, and comply with, all requirements and restrictions described in these IO Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, Company shall be liable for any breach of these IO Terms by any Authorized User.

ii. Subject to these IO Terms, during the term of the IO and for any additional period permitted by Quantcast, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Platform solely to (a) view campaigns set-up in the Platform as part of the Services, and/or (b) view reports generated by the Services.

iii. Company will ensure that its account information is accurate and current. Quantcast reserves the right to review and, if needed, correct, the information and setup associated with Company’s account and Authorized Users.

v.For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing and improving the Services.

  

n. _Client Data_: Upon written request from an advertiser client (“**Client**”), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with their written request (including, without limitation, sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Platform). For clarity, “**Client Data**” means the (i) data Quantcast receives from campaign tag(s) placed by or on behalf of Company or its Clients on websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments that Company may have created using the tag data or any campaign performance data generated from campaigns delivered by Company using such Client Data.

Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast and its directors, officers, employees and agents, its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) violation of these IO Terms (including the 4As Terms and Policies); (b) Company- provided or Client-provided data or ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of subsection j.

In the case of any of the foregoing, Company will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.

d. In the event that Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s reasonable opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing, or, if such remedies are not reasonably available, above, Quantcast shall provide Company with as much written notice as reasonably practicable prior to the effective date of such termination. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section X are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability to Company and Company’s sole remedies as to infringement of intellectual property rights.”

“**XI. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY** QUANTCAST MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE BENEFITS TO COMPANY FROM THE SERVICES, OR THAT THE QUANTCAST PLATFORM OR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY INVENTORY PARTNERS WILL BE ERROR-FREE, ALWAYS AVAILABLE OR OPERATE WITHOUT LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION.

d. In the event that Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s reasonable opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing, or, if such remedies are not reasonably available, above, Quantcast shall provide Company with as much written notice as reasonably practicable prior to the effective date of such termination.

Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is required to maintain at least one Authorized User, and access credentials for that user, during the Services. Each Authorized User will have the ability to add new Authorized Users and terminate access for existing Authorized Users. Company may also request that Quantcast add additional Authorized Users (email being sufficient for such requests). Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users and all activity under its account, including maintaining the confidentiality of its account logins and passwords and shall immediately notify Quantcast in writing of any loss or involuntary disclosure thereof.

**What we do**

Quantcast operates and provides services related to digital marketing. We have products for both advertisers and publishers, and our clients and partners are generally businesses. Our Measure products help website owners to understand the interests and demographics of the people who visit their sites. For companies that want to advertise online, our Advertise products help get their ads in front of the people that are more likely to find them interesting. For consumers, we provide ads that are more useful and relevant to their interests. And for websites, our Advertise products help drive advertising revenue, without which the free Internet we all use every day would not exist. In short, we try to make online advertising more efficient and pleasant for everyone. In order to do all this, we collect and analyze data about individual consumer interests and demographics.

We also offer [Quantcast Choice](https://www.quantcast.com/products/choice-consent-management-platform/), a consent management tool for publishers and advertisers built on the [IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/tcf) that helps website operators provide consumers with information and choices about data. From time to time, we may offer additional products.

[You can read more about privacy in relation to our services here.](https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy).

Quantcast is an active member or participant of industry associations that govern the policies around online consumer privacy in the context of internet-based advertising, including: the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA). Quantcast complies with the [NAI Code of Conduct](https://www.networkadvertising.org/sites/default/files/nai_code2020.pdf), the [DAA Self-Regulatory Principles](http://www.aboutads.info/principles/), and the [EDAA Self-Regulatory Principles](http://www.edaa.eu/european-principles/).

Who we are and what we do
-------------------------

Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers Solutions that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients” or “clients”) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as “Solutions.”

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the [Information Collection](#_2et92p0) section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the [Information use and legal basis](#_fx68ye2m5t7h) section below, we use the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) (“TCF”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

-------------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

As described in the [Who we are and what we do](#_30j0zll) section, we generally use the TCF as the mechanism for describing our Processing activities, and in Europe specifically for establishing our legal basis for Processing and managing users’ preferences for online personalised advertising and related activities. The TCF is designed to allow a digital business to present information and choices to users on its website relating to the Processing of their Personal Information.

We Process Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected or provided to us. The table below describes the specific purposes for which we Process the Personal Information we collect or otherwise obtain about you. This table includes:

* a description of each Processing activity using TCF-specific terminology (to the extent applicable), and
* the legal basis that we rely on to perform each of our Processing activities.

Please note that in Europe, where we indicate that “Legitimate Interests” in accordance with the GDPR is the legal basis for Processing, we carry out the Processing in reliance on our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., our Clients), provided that such interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

International transfers
-----------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, affiliates, or other partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the [European Commision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) and/or the [UK government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation#uk-adequacy) as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy\[at\]quantcast\[dot\]com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

**Your choices and legal rights**
---------------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your Personal Information. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found below.

* **Right of access**: The right to request access to your Personal Information and receive certain information, including the categories of your Personal Information we collect and disclose. To exercise this right, see our [Data Subject Request Form](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/data-subject-rights/).
* **Right of rectification/correction**: The right to request that we rectify (or correct) inaccurate Personal Information about you. In practice, if you seek to exercise your right of rectification/correction, due to the limited Personal Information we Process, we satisfy this right by providing you with the option to request deletion of your Personal Information. To request the deletion of your Personal Information, see our [Data Subject Request Form](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/data-subject-rights/).
* **Right of erasure/deletion**: The right, in certain cases, to request that we delete your Personal Information, provided there are valid grounds for doing so and subject to applicable law and exceptions. To exercise this right, see our [Data Subject Request Form](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/data-subject-rights/).
* **Right to data portability**: The right, in certain cases, to receive a copy of your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and transmit such information to another controller. To exercise this right, see our [Data Subject Request Form](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/data-subject-rights/).
* **Right to object (marketing)**: The right to object to the Processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In practice, we satisfy this right by providing you with the option to opt out of our Processing of your Personal Information for advertising purposes. To exercise this right, see our [Privacy Choices Page](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy-choices/).
* **Right to object (legitimate interests)**: The right to object to the Processing of your Personal Information where we Process it on the basis of our legitimate interests, as described in the [Information Use and Legal Bases](#_fx68ye2m5t7h) section above. Unless we have compelling legitimate grounds or the information is needed for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, we will cease Processing your Personal Information when you object. To exercise this right, see our [Privacy Choices Page](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy-choices/).
* **Right to restrict Processing**: The right, in certain cases, to temporarily restrict our Processing of your Personal Information, provided there are valid grounds for doing so. In practice, if you seek to exercise your right to restrict the Processing of your Personal Information, we will treat it as an exercise of the right on an ongoing, rather than temporary, basis (i.e., the request will be treated as you exercising the right to object to the Processing of your Personal Information). To exercise this right, see our [Privacy Choices Pag](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy-choices/)[e](https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/).
* **Right to withdraw your consent**: The right to withdraw the consent you have provided at any time, where we Process your Personal Information on the basis of your consent. Please note that the lawfulness of any Processing undertaken prior to your withdrawal of consent shall not be affected by the withdrawal. To exercise this right, see our [Privacy Choices Page](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy-choices/).
* **Right to lodge a complaint**: The right to complain to the relevant authority regarding the Processing of your Personal Information by us or on our behalf. In the EU, the lead supervisory authority is the [Irish Data Protection Commissioner.](https://forms.dataprotection.ie/contact) See the section [Contact Us](#_4i7ojhp) below.

Please note that the rights listed above may not be exercised in certain circumstances, such as when the Processing of your Personal Information is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject or for the exercise or defense of legal claims. Additionally, in order to protect your privacy, we may require proof of your identity before we can act on your request but only where it is necessary and proportionate to request this information.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via [dpo \[at\] quantcast \[dot\] com](mailto:dpo@quantcast.com).

If certain jurisdictions, including the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated Processing (i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated Processing that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
-------------------------------------------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Clients for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

**Your choices and legal rights**

Under applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your Personal Information. Additional details about the rights that you may have and how to exercise such rights can be found in the [Your choices and legal rights](#_mrd0d9mm2otr) section above.

Please note that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated Processing that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Who we are and what we do
-------------------------

Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers Solutions that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as “Solutions.”

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the [Information Collection](#_2et92p0) section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the [Information use and legal basis](#_fx68ye2m5t7h) section below, we use the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) (“TCF”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

Scope of this Privacy Policy
----------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of Personal Information for the Solutions only. This Privacy Policy does not cover:

* Personal Information collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of Personal Information in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click [here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#quantcast-website-and-corporate-privacy-policy).
* Any third parties’ handling of Personal Information, unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.

We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our business and/or the digital advertising industry. For a list of defined terms that you should familiarise yourself with to make it easier to review this Privacy Policy, please review the [Key Terms](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms).

For clarity, we want to note that in some circumstances, Quantcast may also process certain Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy as a processor/service provider.

California Notice at Collection: We collect the categories of Personal Information listed in the [Additional information for residents of certain U.S. states](#_gtsgdsjwodpu) section below. As further described in the [Information use and legal basis](#_fx68ye2m5t7h) section below, we collect this information in order to deliver the Solutions and conduct our business. To learn more, please see the [Additional information for residents of certain U.S. states](#_gtsgdsjwodpu) section.

Self-regulatory standards
-------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

Quantcast supports and participates in several digital advertising self-regulatory organisations, as further described below.

* We are members of the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](https://thenai.org/).
* We participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and adhere to the [DAA Self-Regulatory Principles](https://youradchoices.com/principles).

* We participate in, and comply with, the policies and technical specifications of the [IAB Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF)](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) as a vendor. Quantcast’s IAB Europe-assigned identification number is Vendor ID #11.

Please see the [Your choices and legal rights](#_mrd0d9mm2otr) section of this Privacy Policy for more information about the opt-out tools offered by the NAI, DAA, and EDAA.

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a preference that you can set in certain web browsers to inform the websites you visit that you do not want information about your online activity collected over time and across third-party websites or online services. We do not honor DNT at this time, due to the lack of a clear industry standard. Please visit the [Quantcast Privacy Choices](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy-choices/) page for your opt-out options.

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

As described in the [Who we are and what we do](#_30j0zll) section, we generally use the TCF as the mechanism for describing our Processing activities, and in Europe specifically for establishing our legal basis for Processing and managing users’ preferences for online personalised advertising and related activities. The TCF is designed to allow a digital business to present information and choices to users on its website relating to the Processing of their Personal Information.

We Process Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected or provided to us. The table below describes the specific purposes for which we Process the Personal Information we collect or otherwise obtain about you. This table includes:

* a description of each Processing activity using TCF-specific terminology (to the extent applicable), and
* the legal basis that we rely on to perform each of our Processing activities.

Please note that in Europe, where we indicate that “Legitimate Interests” in accordance with the GDPR is the legal basis for Processing, we carry out the Processing in reliance on our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., our Clients), provided that such interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the [European Commision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) and/or the [UK government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation#uk-adequacy) as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy\[at\]quantcast\[dot\]com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

If certain jurisdictions, including the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated Processing (i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated Processing that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
-------------------------------------------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Clients for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Who we are and what we do
-------------------------

Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers Solutions that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as “Solutions.”

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the [Information Collection](#_2et92p0) section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the [Information use and legal basis](#_fx68ye2m5t7h) section below, we use the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) (“TCF”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

Scope of this Privacy Policy
----------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

It also does not pertain to the collection and use of Personal Information in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click [here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#quantcast-website-and-corporate-privacy-policy).
* Any third parties’ handling of Personal Information, unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.

We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our business and/or the digital advertising industry. For a list of defined terms that you should familiarise yourself with to make it easier to review this Privacy Policy, please review the [Key Terms](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms).

For clarity, we want to note that in some circumstances, Quantcast may also process certain Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy as a processor/service provider.

Self-regulatory standards
-------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

Quantcast supports and participates in several digital advertising self-regulatory organisations, as further described below.

Please see the [Your choices and legal rights](#_mrd0d9mm2otr) section of this Privacy Policy for more information about the opt-out tools offered by the NAI, DAA, and EDAA.

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a preference that you can set in certain web browsers to inform the websites you visit that you do not want information about your online activity collected over time and across third-party websites or online services. We do not honor DNT at this time, due to the lack of a clear industry standard. Please visit the [Quantcast Privacy Choices](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy-choices/) page for your opt-out options.

International transfers
-----------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or other partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.

We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy\[at\]quantcast\[dot\]com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Clients for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Who we are and what we do
-------------------------

Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as “Solutions.”

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the [Information Collection](#information-collection) section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the [Information use and legal basis](#information-use-and-legal-basis) section below, we use the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) (“TCF”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

Information use and legal basis
-------------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

As described in the [Who we are and what we do](#who-we-are) section, we generally use the TCF as the mechanism for describing our Processing activities, and in Europe specifically for establishing our legal basis for Processing and managing users’ preferences for online personalised advertising and related activities. The TCF is designed to allow a digital business to present information and choices to users on its website relating to the Processing of their Personal Information.

We Process Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected or provided to us. The table below describes the specific purposes for which we Process the Personal Information we collect or otherwise obtain about you. This table includes:

* the purposes for which Quantcast Processes Personal Information ,which are tied to the defined purposes for Processing, special purposes, and features set forth in the [TCF Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) and official technical documentation disseminated by IAB Europe where applicable(see Appendix A of the [TCF Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) for examples and illustrations of the purposes, special purposes and features)
* a description of each Processing activity using TCF-specific terminology (to the extent applicable), and
* the legal basis that we rely on to perform each of our Processing activities.

Please note that in Europe, where we indicate that “Legitimate Interests” in accordance with the GDPR is the legal basis for Processing, we carry out the Processing in reliance on our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., our Clients), provided that such interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

International transfers
-----------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](http://quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or other partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the [European Commision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) and/or the [UK government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation#uk-adequacy) as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy\[at\]quantcast\[dot\]com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

Please note that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated Processing that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
-------------------------------------------------------------

_See_ [_Key Terms_](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) _for definitions of capitalized terms._

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Who we are and what we do
-------------------------

Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and [Audiences](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) with the right advertising.

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the “[Information Collection](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms)” section below, we may join or match [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) about you, which may include your [Online Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or [Offline Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called [Cross-Media Matching/Linking](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms). To the extent that we combine [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms), otherwise obtain and [Process](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the “[Information use and legal basis](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms)” section below, we use the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (“[TCF](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#tcf)”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the [TCF](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) is one means of explaining [Processing](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) activities, and because our [Processing](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) activities are consistent globally, the [TCF Purposes](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) are applicable to all [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we [Process](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

International transfers
-----------------------

Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.

We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) will be [Processed](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process). For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that is collected as Quantcast [Cookies](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#cookie), or using [Pixels, Tags and SDKs](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pixels-tags-and-sdks) deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) of other [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and [Process](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) the [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information). In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) when we are [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pseudonymous-identifiers) or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Who we are and what we do
-------------------------

Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and [Audiences](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) with the right advertising.

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the “[Information Collection](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms)” section below, we may join or match [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) about you, which may include your [Online Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or [Offline Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called [Cross-Media Matching/Linking](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms). To the extent that we combine [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms), otherwise obtain and [Process](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the “[Information use and legal basis](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms)” section below, we use the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (“[TCF](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#tcf)”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the [TCF](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) is one means of explaining [Processing](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) activities, and because our [Processing](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) activities are consistent globally, the [TCF Purposes](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) are applicable to all [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we [Process](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

International transfers
-----------------------

Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.

We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) will be [Processed](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process). For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that is collected as Quantcast [Cookies](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#cookie), or using [Pixels, Tags and SDKs](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pixels-tags-and-sdks) deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) of other [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and [Process](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) the [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information). In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) when we are [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pseudonymous-identifiers) or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Who we are and what we do
-------------------------

Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and [Audiences](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) with the right advertising.

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the “[Information Collection](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms)” section below, we may join or match [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) about you, which may include your [Online Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or [Offline Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called [Cross-Media Matching/Linking](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms). To the extent that we combine [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms), otherwise obtain and [Process](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the “[Information use and legal basis](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms)” section below, we use the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (“[TCF](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#tcf)”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the [TCF](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) is one means of explaining [Processing](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) activities, and because our [Processing](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) activities are consistent globally, the [TCF Purposes](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) are applicable to all [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) that we [Process](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

Scope of this Privacy Policy
----------------------------

Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) will be [Processed](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process). For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that is collected as Quantcast [Cookies](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#cookie), or using [Pixels, Tags and SDKs](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pixels-tags-and-sdks) deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) of other [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and [Process](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) the [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information). In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) when we are [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pseudonymous-identifiers) or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Who we are and what we do
-------------------------

Quantcast (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “Clients”) understand and grow their audiences (the “Solutions”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and [Audiences](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#audience) with the right advertising.

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the “[Information Collection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lEkN8dtde_3QIpsh1X0ZBLGYZlqZpCNS6hi-gk9owks/edit#heading=h.2et92p0)” section below, we may join or match [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) about you, which may include your [Online Data](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#online-data) from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (“CTVs”)), that have implemented Quantcast [Pixels, Tags or SDKs](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pixels-tags-and-sdks) (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or [Offline Data](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#offline-data) . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called [Cross-Media Matching/Linking](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#cross-media-matching-linking). To the extent that we combine [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information), otherwise obtain and [Process](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the “[Information use and legal basis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lEkN8dtde_3QIpsh1X0ZBLGYZlqZpCNS6hi-gk9owks/edit#heading=h.fx68ye2m5t7h)” section below, we use the [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#iab-transparency-consent-framework-tcf) (“[TCF](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#tcf)”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Because the [TCF](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#tcf) is one means of explaining [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) activities, and because our [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) activities are consistent globally, the [TCF Purposes](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#tcf-purpose-tcf-special-purpose) are applicable to all [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that we [Process](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

In practice, if you seek to exercise your right to restrict the [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) of your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information), we will treat it as an exercise of the right on an ongoing, rather than temporary, basis (i.e., the request will be treated as you exercising the right to object to the [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) of your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information)).

Please note that the rights listed above may not be exercised in certain circumstances, such as when the [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) of your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject or for the exercise or defense of legal claims. Additionally, in order to protect your privacy, we may require proof of your identity before we can act on your request but only where it is necessary and proportionate to request this information.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland and have issues or questions about the above-listed rights, you may contact our European Data Protection Officer via [dpo@quantcast.com](mailto:dpo@quantcast.com).

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, under applicable law, you also generally have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automated [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) (i.e., an operation that is performed without any human intervention), if it produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services). Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

Additional information for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) will be [Processed](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process). For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) that is collected as Quantcast [Cookies](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#cookie), or using [Pixels, Tags and SDKs](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pixels-tags-and-sdks) deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) of other [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and [Process](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) the [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information). In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of [Personal Information](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information) when we are [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast [Pseudonymous Identifier](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#pseudonymous-identifiers) or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

Please note, however, that Quantcast does not make decisions based solely on automated [Processing](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/key-terms/#process) that produce a legal effect or similarly significantly affect individuals.

**Who we are and what we do**
-----------------------------

Quantcast (“**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) is a global digital advertising technology group of companies. Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “**Clients**”) understand and grow their audiences (the “**Solutions**”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and [Audiences](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) with the right advertising.

To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses [Personal Information](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the “[Information Collection](https://app.pactsafe.com/contracts/337835/edit#_heading=h.tyjcwt)” section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your [Online Data](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms) from your visits across different digital properties, like websites or mobile apps, that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the “[Information use and legal basis](https://app.pactsafe.com/contracts/337835/edit#_heading=h.3dy6vkm)” section below, we use the Transparency and Consent Framework (“**TCF**”) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information’s country of origin).

In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. Personal Information relating to individuals located within the United States provided to or gathered by us in connection with the delivery of the Solutions is controlled by Quantcast Corporation.

Outside of the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast International Limited, located at Beaux Lane House, Lower Mercer Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. In so far as Quantcast acts as a “controller” (as defined under applicable law), Quantcast International Limited is the controller of your Personal Information if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any other jurisdiction outside of the United States.

**Scope of this Privacy Policy**
--------------------------------

This Privacy Policy covers Quantcast’s use of Personal Information for the Solutions only. This Privacy Policy does not cover:

* Quantcast’s privacy management products, which include our TCF consent management platform (“CMP”), Quantcast Choice. For more information about Quantcast Choice, please click here.
* Personal Information collected from our website, www.quantcast.com, except to the extent that we use our own Solutions on our website. It also does not pertain to the collection and use of Personal Information in connection with our corporate functions, such as marketing, recruiting, people management, business-to-business communications, and so forth. For our privacy policy relating to our website and our corporate functions, please click [here](https://legal.quantcast.com/#quantcast-website-and-corporate-privacy-policy).
* Any third parties’ handling of Personal Information, unless explicitly stated otherwise. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other companies that you engage or interact with to understand their information handling and privacy practices.

We use some phrases in this Privacy Policy that are unique to our business and/or the digital advertising industry. For a list of defined terms that you should familiarise yourself with to make it easier to review this Privacy Policy, please review the [Key Terms](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms).

**_California Notice at Collection_**: We collect the categories of Personal Information listed in the “Categories of personal information collected” subsection of the “[California privacy rights](#california-privacy-rights)” section below. As further described in the “[Information use and legal basis](https://information-use-and-legal-basis/)” section below, we collect this information in order to deliver the Solutions and conduct our business. To learn more, please see the “[California privacy rights”](#california-privacy-rights) section.

**Self-regulatory standards**
-----------------------------

Quantcast supports and participates in several digital advertising self-regulatory organisations, as further described below.

* We are members in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adhere to the [NAI 2020 Code of Conduct](https://thenai.org/accountability/code-enforcement/).

Please see the “[Your choices and legal rights](#your-choices)” section of this Privacy Policy for more information about the opt-out tools offered by the NAI, DAA, and EDAA.

_Do Not Track (“_**_DNT_**_”)_ is a preference that you can set in certain web browsers to inform the websites you visit that you do not want information about your online activity collected over time and across third-party websites or online services. We do not honor DNT or other similar signals at this time, due to the lack of a clear industry standard.

Bid Request Data includes information about your visit to the publisher’s digital property, which helps us understand where an ad will be displayed, Device Information, and who might see it.

Bid Request Data also commonly includes a Pseudonymous Identifier (if available), the content that the ad would serve into, the type of device the ad would be served on, the Imprecise / Approximate Location Information of the device, the size of the ad, and consent information. Because Bid Requests include information about the content you are visiting, over time, accumulated Bid Requests may show your browsing behavior.

**Information use and legal basis**
-----------------------------------

As described in the “[Who we are and what we do](#who-we-are-and)” section, we generally use the TCF as the mechanism for describing our Processing activities, and in Europe specifically for establishing our legal basis for Processing and managing users’ preferences for online personalised advertising and related activities. The TCF is designed to allow a digital business to present information and choices to users on its website relating to the Processing of their Personal Information.

We Process Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected or provided to us. The table below describes the specific purposes for which we Process the Personal Information we collect or otherwise obtain about you. This table includes:

* the purposes for which Quantcast Processes Personal Information (which are tied to the defined purposes for Processing, special purposes, and features set forth in the [TCF Policies](https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/) and official technical documentation disseminated by IAB Europe where applicable),
* a description of each Processing activity using TCF-specific terminology (to the extent applicable), and
* the legal basis that we rely on to perform each of our Processing activities.

Please note that in Europe, where we indicate that “[Legitimate Interests](https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms)” in accordance with the GDPR is the legal basis for Processing, we carry out the Processing in reliance on our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., our Clients), provided that such interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

In the provision of the Solutions to some Clients, Quantcast may correlate information between entries within its own datasets that have the same Pseudonymous Identifier or with information obtained from Ad Serving, Ad Verification, or Data Management Platforms/Data Providers. We do this to provide aggregated reporting to Clients about the number of visitors to their digital properties.

Quantcast does not apply Panel or similarly derived Audience Insights data to ad measurement data without a separate legal basis to apply market research to generate Audience Insights.

These insights and reports may contain aggregated data from which individual users cannot be uniquely identified or data from which Quantcast has removed Pseudonymous Identifiers.

**Information security**
------------------------

We employ appropriate organisational and technical security safeguards designed to keep Personal Information secure when it is transmitted to us and once we receive it. These measures may include encryption and employment of information storage security technologies to restrict access to our network. However, please be aware that no method of transmitting information over the internet or storing information is completely secure.

**Information retention**
-------------------------

We retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as described in the “[Information Collection](#information-collection)” section above, except where we are required to retain the information for a longer period of time. Once Personal Information has reached its retention period, as applicable, we may either de-identify it (for CCPA purposes), anonymise it (for GDPR purposes) or permanently delete it.

**International transfers**
---------------------------

Quantcast operates a global service, and we engage vendors located around the world to help us deliver the Solutions. Accordingly, your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country or region in which you reside, including to the United States and other countries where either our data centers, vendors, affiliates, or Partners are located. Where we transfer your Personal Information internationally, we do so in accordance with applicable law.

If you are based in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that we may need to transfer your Personal Information to countries that have not been recognised by the [European Commision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) and/or the [UK government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation#uk-adequacy) as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information. We generally use EU Standard Contractual Clauses (to facilitate both controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers) or other government-approved contracts that provide appropriate safeguards for Personal Information that is transferred to countries that have not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. You can contact us at privacy@quantcast.com to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

In certain limited circumstances, we rely on other lawful mechanisms for international transfers of Personal Information or rely on derogations, such as the contractual necessity derogation.

**Additional disclosures for EEA, UK, and Switzerland residents**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, please note that the Solutions are provided by our European entity, Quantcast International Limited. In Processing Personal Information in the context of providing the Solutions to our Clients, Quantcast Internal Limited generally acts as a data controller. More specifically, Quantcast International Limited is a joint controller along with its Client when we jointly determine the purposes for which your Personal Information will be Processed. For example, we are joint controllers with Advertisers and Publishers for Personal Information that is collected as Quantcast Cookies, or using Pixels, Tags and SDKs deployed by our Clients on their digital properties, and for the Processing of other Personal Information introduced into the Solutions directly by the Client. This is because both Quantcast and the Client have influence over whether and how we collect and Process the Personal Information. In limited situations, Quantcast is the sole data controller of Personal Information when we are Processing it for our own independent purposes, for instance when we use a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier or we derive aggregated analytics for modeling, developing our algorithms, or improving the Solutions.

**QUANTCAST BUYER TERMS**

**Last Updated: June 5, 2025**

_If Company has an active, duly executed contract for one or more of the Services, that existing agreement will govern Company’s use of such Services within the scope of such agreement instead of these Quantcast Buyer Terms (“_**_Agreement_**_”)._

This Agreement is a legally binding contract between Quantcast and Company. “**Company**” means (A) when an individual accepts this Agreement on his or her own behalf, such individual, or (B) when an individual accepts this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, that company or legal entity. “**Quantcast**” means (X) Quantcast Corp. if Company is domiciled in the United States, (Y) Quantcast Australia Pty. Ltd. if Company is domiciled in any country or territory located in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and (Z) Quantcast International Limited if Company is domiciled in any other country or territory.

Quantcast may modify this Agreement. Quantcast will notify Company by making the revised version available on this page or an identified successor page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made. If Company does not accept the changes, Company must stop using the Services. Company’s continued use of the Services after Quantcast publishes changes means that Company consents to the updates.

**1.** **Incorporated Terms**

This Agreement incorporates the following additional terms (“**Incorporated Terms**”), as updated from time to time:

* [Quantcast Campaign Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy) (“**Campaign Policy**”)
* [Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Buyers](https://legal.quantcast.com/#privacy-implementation-for-quantcast-advertiser-partners) (“**Privacy Implementation**”)
* [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum), to the extent the Services include processing Personal Information subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in such Addendum) (“**DPA**”)
* [International Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-data-privacy-addendum), to the extent that the Services include processing Personal Data subject to International Privacy Laws (as defined in such Addendum) (also “**DPA**”)
* Any applicable [Additional Terms](https://legal.quantcast.com/#additional-terms-ad-buyer) (defined below)

**2.** **Services**

2.1. “**Services**” means the Quantcast platform (“**Platform**”) and, to the extent provided by Quantcast under this Agreement, Campaign Tags, Platform Data, and any other services provided by Quantcast. The Services may permit Company to purchase ad placements on third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video, and other content/properties) (“**Inventory**”) that are made available by third-party providers (“**Inventory Providers**”) and Third-Party Services (defined below). For clarity, the “Services” do not include Inventory or Third-Party Services.

2.2. Some Services may be subject to different or additional terms (“**Additional Terms**”) that are described on the Additional Terms page linked above, in the Platform or otherwise made available to Company in writing. Unless the parties agree in writing for Quantcast to provide campaign management services or professional services, the Services do not include those services.

**3.** **Accounts and Authorized Users**

3.1. Company will ensure its account information is accurate and current. Company will promptly notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of Company access credentials. Quantcast

may review and, if needed, correct, the information and setup associated with Company’s account and Authorized Users. Company must obtain Quantcast’s prior written consent before adding third-party Authorized Users (i.e., non-employees) and Quantcast may require such third-party Authorized Users to enter into separate terms with Quantcast.

3.2. “**Authorized User**” means an individual authorized by Company to use Company’s account on the Platform. Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users, the level of permissioning of each Authorized User, and all activity under its account, including the confidentiality of all access credentials. Without limiting the foregoing, Company will immediately notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of any access credentials. Company will ensure that all Authorized Users use Company’s account solely on behalf of Company, and are aware of, and comply with, this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is liable for any breach of this Agreement by any Authorized User.

**4.** **Company Clients**

If Company is using the Services on behalf of third-party clients (“**Clients**”), Company represents and warrants that it has all rights and authorizations needed to do so. Company will only use the Services for Clients with which Company has a direct written agency agreement and will obligate its Clients to comply with this Agreement, including the Incorporated Terms. Company is responsible for the actions and/or inactions of Clients and for ensuring their compliance.

**5.** **Fees and Payment**

5.1. Fees will be provided in the Platform or by other written means.

5.2. Unless Quantcast approves a different payment arrangement in writing, Company authorizes Quantcast to charge amounts owed under this Agreement to Company’s credit card, via automatic ACH, or such other similar payment method, at Quantcast’s option. Company will provide its most current credit card and/or other information required to complete payment, and keep such information updated if it changes. For the avoidance of doubt, if Company makes credit card, wire transfer or ACH payments or such other similar payment method, Company agrees to the applicable third-party terms as set forth in the Additional Terms. If Quantcast authorizes Company to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Quantcast may revise Company’s credit limit, require prepayment, or adjust permitted payment methods at any time in its sole discretion. Quantcast may charge interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments. Company is responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs that Quantcast incurs to collect unpaid invoices. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid for Services provided are non-refundable. If Company requires a purchase order to make payments, Company will include the corresponding purchase order number in the Platform. All amounts due must be paid without setoff or deduction.

5.3. Company is solely responsible for all amounts due for any Third-Party Services that Company opts to use. Company acknowledges that any charges for Third-Party Services shown in the Platform or otherwise provided by Quantcast are based on the information Quantcast receives from the third parties and are subject to the final amounts charged by such third parties.

5.4. Quantcast is the system of record and is solely responsible for calculating all metrics related to the Services, including all amounts owed under this Agreement. Company acknowledges that all metrics, fees and other amounts shown in Platform are preliminary and final amounts will be as confirmed, invoiced or billed by Quantcast.

5.5. All charges under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes and duties, if any. Company is responsible for and must pay all sales and use or other transactional taxes and duties including interest and penalty imposed on the amounts charged hereunder, or from the performance of this Agreement for which Quantcast issues an invoice. Company will promptly reimburse Quantcast for any such tax or duty and indemnify Quantcast and hold Quantcast harmless for any such taxes and duties that Quantcast must pay to a tax authority for which Company is responsible. If Company claims a tax exemption, Company must provide Quantcast with appropriate exemption certificates or documentation charges (including, without limitation, VAT or GST) acceptable to tax authorities.

**6.** **Services License and Requirements**

6.1. Company may use the Services solely as set forth in this Agreement. Subject to this Agreement, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to

(a) access and use the Services on a self-serve basis, and (b) use the Platform Data presented via the Services solely for the purpose of using the Services.

6.2. Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”). Company will not use the Services with Ads, Company Media, other content or products or services that violate any applicable laws, regulations, third-party rights, or this Agreement including the Incorporated Terms. If Company asks Quantcast to take actions on behalf of Company or otherwise assist with Company’s use of the Services, Company consents to the actions and/or inactions that Quantcast takes on its behalf and retains sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.

6.3. Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Services security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Services to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of a Client, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Services, including Platform Data, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Services or to end users, (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than the relevant Client who is obligated to treat such reports confidentially) or (g) use information collected during the course of Campaigns (e.g., via Company’s own tag, third party tags, etc.) outside Company’s use of the Services, including to create or enrich profiles of individual end users, including regarding third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video and other content/properties) that the end users have visited or the content or general interest area of such media. For example, Company may not create an audience of a particular publisher’s end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.

6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.

6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.

6.6. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.

**7.** **Data Issues**

7.1. Data Definitions**:**

7.1.1. “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.

7.1.2. “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.

7.1.3. “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data under this Agreement. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags or Measure tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving or Quantcast Measure).

7.1.4. “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider).

Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences and other data). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.

7.1.5. “**Company Media**” means the Ads, websites, apps and other digital properties and content on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.

7.1.6. “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).

7.1.7. “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.

7.1.8. “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.

7.2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company

Data with any third-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non- Company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.

7.3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.

7.4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.

7.5. Models: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated for the purpose of Company’s Campaigns with other customers.

7.6. Client Data: Upon request from a Client (or an authorized third party on Client’s behalf, including Company), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.

7.7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.

**8.** **Compliance and Privacy**

8.1. Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.

8.2. Company will not use the Service or any Third Party Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or

(b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children; or (c) data related to any end user that has requested deletion or opted out (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 18 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

8.3. Company represents and warrants that it is not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and does not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations. If Company is using the Services on behalf of Clients, Company represents and warrants that Clients are not covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and do not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations.

**9.** **Third-Party Services**

9.1. If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.

9.2. Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.

9.3. Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

**10.** **Marketing, Publicity**

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement.

**11.** **Confidentiality**

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

**12.** **Indemnity**

12.1. Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.

12.2. The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.

12.3. Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected and/or purchased by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.

12.4. If Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section 12 are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability and Company’s sole remedy as to infringement.

**13.** **Account Closure, Termination and Suspension**

13.1. Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure or termination of this Agreement, in addition to any other sections that by their nature would be presumed to, will survive account closure or termination.

13.2. Without limiting any other remedies, Quantcast may immediately suspend or terminate any individual Campaign, Authorized User’s access, and/or Company or Client account, including if Quantcast in its sole discretion suspects that a Campaign, Authorized User, Client, or Company is in breach this Agreement (including, without limitation, any failure to comply with the Incorporated Terms. If Quantcast suspends or closes Company’s account, Company may not re-open an account without Quantcast’s prior written approval.

**14.** **DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

14.1. QUANTCAST MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING PERFORMANCE OR THE RESULTS AND BENEFITS FROM THE SERVICES, OR THAT THE PLATFORM OR ANY INFORMATION WILL BE ERROR-FREE, ALWAYS AVAILABLE OR OPERATE WITHOUT LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION. QUANTCAST HAS NO LIABILITY FOR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES. QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ANY OR ALL SERVICES AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.

14.2. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION (SECTION 12), NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE OR LOSS OF PROFIT) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER WHATEVER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY BROUGHT (INCLUDING CONTRACT OR NEGLIGENCE), EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**QUANTCAST BUYER TERMS**
=========================

**Last Updated: March 6, 2025**

_If Company has an active, duly executed contract for one or more of the Services, that existing agreement will govern Company’s use of such Services within the scope of such agreement instead of these Quantcast Buyer Terms (“_**_Agreement_**_”)._

This Agreement is a legally binding contract between Quantcast and Company. “**Company**” means (A) when an individual accepts this Agreement on his or her own behalf, such individual, or (B) when an individual accepts this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, that company or legal entity. “**Quantcast**” means (X) Quantcast Corp. if Company is domiciled in the United States, (Y) Quantcast Australia Pty. Ltd. if Company is domiciled in any country or territory located in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and (Z) Quantcast International Limited if Company is domiciled in any other country or territory.

Quantcast may modify this Agreement. Quantcast will notify Company by making the revised version available on this page or an identified successor page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made. If Company does not accept the changes, Company must stop using the Services. Company’s continued use of the Services after Quantcast publishes changes means that Company consents to the updates.

**1.** **Incorporated Terms**
=============================

This Agreement incorporates the following additional terms (“**Incorporated Terms**”), as updated from time to time:

* [Quantcast Campaign Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy) (“**Campaign Policy**”)
* [Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Buyers](https://legal.quantcast.com/#privacy-implementation-for-quantcast-advertiser-partners) (“**Privacy Implementation**”)
* [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum), to the extent the Services include processing Personal Information subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in such Addendum) (“**DPA**”)
* [International Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-data-privacy-addendum), to the extent that the Services include processing Personal Data subject to International Privacy Laws (as defined in such Addendum) (also “**DPA**”)
* Any applicable [Additional Terms](https://legal.quantcast.com/#additional-terms-ad-buyer) (defined below)

**2.** **Services**
===================

2.1. “**Services**” means the Quantcast platform (“**Platform**”) and, to the extent provided by Quantcast under this Agreement, Campaign Tags, Platform Data, and any other services provided by Quantcast. The Services may permit Company to purchase ad placements on third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video, and other content/properties) (“**Inventory**”) that are made available by third-party providers (“**Inventory Providers**”) and Third-Party Services (defined below). For clarity, the “Services” do not include Inventory or Third-Party Services.

2.2. Some Services may be subject to different or additional terms (“**Additional Terms**”) that are described on the Additional Terms page linked above, in the Platform or otherwise made available to Company in writing. Unless the parties agree in writing for Quantcast to provide campaign management services or professional services, the Services do not include those services.

**3.** **Accounts and Authorized Users**
========================================

3.1. Company will ensure its account information is accurate and current. Company will promptly notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of Company access credentials. Quantcast

may review and, if needed, correct, the information and setup associated with Company’s account and Authorized Users. Company must obtain Quantcast’s prior written consent before adding third-party Authorized Users (i.e., non-employees) and Quantcast may require such third-party Authorized Users to enter into separate terms with Quantcast.

3.2. “**Authorized User**” means an individual authorized by Company to use Company’s account on the Platform. Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users, the level of permissioning of each Authorized User, and all activity under its account, including the confidentiality of all access credentials. Without limiting the foregoing, Company will immediately notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of any access credentials. Company will ensure that all Authorized Users use Company’s account solely on behalf of Company, and are aware of, and comply with, this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is liable for any breach of this Agreement by any Authorized User.

**4.** **Company Clients**
==========================

If Company is using the Services on behalf of third-party clients (“**Clients**”), Company represents and warrants that it has all rights and authorizations needed to do so. Company will only use the Services for Clients with which Company has a direct written agency agreement and will obligate its Clients to comply with this Agreement, including the Incorporated Terms. Company is responsible for the actions and/or inactions of Clients and for ensuring their compliance.

**5.** **Fees and Payment**
===========================

5.1. Fees will be provided in the Platform or by other written means.

5.2. Unless Quantcast approves a different payment arrangement in writing, Company authorizes Quantcast to charge amounts owed under this Agreement to Company’s credit card, via automatic ACH, or such other similar payment method, at Quantcast’s option. Company will provide its most current credit card and/or other information required to complete payment, and keep such information updated if it changes. For the avoidance of doubt, if Company makes credit card, wire transfer or ACH payments or such other similar payment method, Company agrees to the applicable third-party terms as set forth in the Additional Terms. If Quantcast authorizes Company to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Quantcast may revise Company’s credit limit or require prepayment at any time in its sole discretion. Quantcast may charge interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments. Company is responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs that Quantcast incurs to collect unpaid invoices. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid for Services provided are non-refundable. If Company requires a purchase order to make payments, Company will include the corresponding purchase order number in the Platform. All amounts due must be paid without setoff or deduction.

5.3. Company is solely responsible for all amounts due for any Third-Party Services that Company opts to use. Company acknowledges that any charges for Third-Party Services shown in the Platform or otherwise provided by Quantcast are based on the information Quantcast receives from the third parties and are subject to the final amounts charged by such third parties.

5.4. Quantcast is the system of record and is solely responsible for calculating all metrics related to the Services, including all amounts owed under this Agreement. Company acknowledges that all metrics, fees and other amounts shown in Platform are preliminary and final amounts will be as confirmed, invoiced or billed by Quantcast.

5.5. All charges under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes and duties, if any. Company is responsible for and must pay all sales and use or other transactional taxes and duties including interest and penalty imposed on the amounts charged hereunder, or from the performance of this Agreement for which Quantcast issues an invoice. Company will promptly reimburse Quantcast for any such tax or duty and indemnify Quantcast and hold Quantcast harmless for any such taxes and duties that Quantcast must pay to a tax authority for which Company is responsible. If Company claims a tax exemption, Company must provide Quantcast with appropriate exemption certificates or documentation charges (including, without limitation, VAT or GST) acceptable to tax authorities.

**6.** **Services License and Requirements**
============================================

6.1. Company may use the Services solely as set forth in this Agreement. Subject to this Agreement, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to

(a) access and use the Services on a self-serve basis, and (b) use the Platform Data presented via the Services solely for the purpose of using the Services.

6.2. Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”). Company will not use the Services with Ads, Company Media, other content or products or services that violate any applicable laws, regulations, third-party rights, or this Agreement including the Incorporated Terms. If Company asks Quantcast to take actions on behalf of Company or otherwise assist with Company’s use of the Services, Company consents to the actions and/or inactions that Quantcast takes on its behalf and retains sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.

6.3. Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Services security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Services to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of a Client, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Services, including Platform Data, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Services or to end users, (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than the relevant Client who is obligated to treat such reports confidentially) or (g) use information collected during the course of Campaigns (e.g., via Company’s own tag, third party tags, etc.) outside Company’s use of the Services, including to create or enrich profiles of individual end users, including regarding third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video and other content/properties) that the end users have visited or the content or general interest area of such media. For example, Company may not create an audience of a particular publisher’s end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.

6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.

6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.

6.6. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.

**7.** **Data Issues**
======================

7.1. Data Definitions**:**

7.1.1. “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.

7.1.2. “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.

7.1.3. “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data under this Agreement. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags or Measure tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving or Quantcast Measure).

7.1.4. “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider).

Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.

7.1.5. “**Company Media**” means the Ads, websites, apps and other digital properties and content on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.

7.1.6. “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).

7.1.7. “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.

7.1.8. “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.

7.2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company

Data with any third-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non- Company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.

7.3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.

7.4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.

7.5. Models: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated for the purpose of Company’s Campaigns with other customers.

7.6. Client Data: Upon request from a Client (or an authorized third party on Client’s behalf, including Company), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.

7.7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.

**8.** **Compliance and Privacy**
=================================

8.1. Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.

8.2. Company will not use the Service or any Third Party Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or

(b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children; or (c) data related to any end user that has requested deletion or opted out (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

8.3. Company represents and warrants that it is not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and does not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations. If Company is using the Services on behalf of Clients, Company represents and warrants that Clients are not covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and do not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations.

**9.** **Third-Party Services**
===============================

9.1. If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.

9.2. Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.

9.3. Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

**10.** **Marketing, Publicity**
================================

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement.

**11.** **Confidentiality**
===========================

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

**12.** **Indemnity**
=====================

12.1. Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.

12.2. The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.

12.3. Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected and/or purchased by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.

12.4. If Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section 12 are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability and Company’s sole remedy as to infringement.

**13.** **Account Closure, Termination and Suspension**
=======================================================

13.1. Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure or termination of this Agreement, in addition to any other sections that by their nature would be presumed to, will survive account closure or termination.

13.2. Without limiting any other remedies, Quantcast may immediately suspend or terminate any individual Campaign, Authorized User’s access, and/or Company or Client account, including if Quantcast in its sole discretion suspects that a Campaign, Authorized User, Client, or Company is in breach this Agreement (including, without limitation, any failure to comply with the Incorporated Terms.

**14.** **DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

QUANTCAST HAS NO LIABILITY FOR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES. QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ANY OR ALL SERVICES AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.

14.2. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION (SECTION 12), NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE OR LOSS OF PROFIT) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER WHATEVER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY BROUGHT (INCLUDING CONTRACT OR NEGLIGENCE), EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 14.2 LIMITS ANY LIABILITY FOR FRAUD, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT LEGALLY BE LIMITED.

14.3. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO PAYMENTS DUE (SECTION 5), AND/OR INDEMNIFICATION (SECTION 12), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (US $100,000) OR (B) THE ACTUAL AMOUNT PAID AND/OR PAYABLE TO QUANTCAST FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO COMPANY IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE THE LIABILITY FIRST AROSE.

14.4. The limitations and exclusions contained in this Agreement represent the parties’ agreement based upon the perceived level of risk associated with this Agreement and the payments made hereunder.

**15.** **General**.
====================

15.1. This Agreement is the entire agreement of the parties relating to the Services and it supersedes all other commitments and understandings with respect to the Services.

**QUANTCAST BUYER TERMS**
=========================

**Last Updated: September 19, 2024**

_If Company has an active, duly executed contract for one or more of the Services, that existing agreement will govern Company’s use of such Services within the scope of such agreement instead of these Quantcast Buyer Terms (“_**_Agreement_**_”)._

This Agreement is a legally binding contract between Quantcast and Company. “**Company**” means (A) when an individual accepts this Agreement on his or her own behalf, such individual, or (B) when an individual accepts this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, that company or legal entity. “**Quantcast**” means (X) Quantcast Corp. if Company is domiciled in the United States, (Y) Quantcast Australia Pty. Ltd. if Company is domiciled in any country or territory located in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and (Z) Quantcast International Limited if Company is domiciled in any other country or territory.

Quantcast may modify this Agreement. Quantcast will notify Company by making the revised version available on this page or an identified successor page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made. If Company does not accept the changes, Company must stop using the Services. Company’s continued use of the Services after Quantcast publishes changes means that Company consents to the updates.

**1.** **Incorporated Terms**
=============================

This Agreement incorporates the following additional terms (“**Incorporated Terms**”), as updated from time to time:

* [Quantcast Campaign Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy) (“**Campaign Policy**”)
* [Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Buyers](https://legal.quantcast.com/#privacy-implementation-for-quantcast-advertiser-partners) (“**Privacy Implementation**”)
* [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum), to the extent the Services include processing Personal Information subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in such Addendum) (“**DPA**”)
* [International Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-data-privacy-addendum), to the extent that the Services include processing Personal Data subject to International Privacy Laws (as defined in such Addendum) (also “**DPA**”)
* Any applicable [Additional Terms](https://legal.quantcast.com/#additional-terms-ad-buyer) (defined below)

**2.** **Services**
===================

2.1. “**Services**” means the Quantcast platform (“**Platform**”) and, to the extent provided by Quantcast under this Agreement, Campaign Tags, Platform Data, and any other services provided by Quantcast. The Services may permit Company to purchase ad placements on third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video, and other content/properties) (“**Inventory**”) that are made available by third-party providers (“**Inventory Providers**”) and Third-Party Services (defined below). For clarity, the “Services” do not include Inventory or Third-Party Services.

2.2. Some Services may be subject to different or additional terms (“**Additional Terms**”) that are described on the Additional Terms page linked above, in the Platform or otherwise made available to Company in writing. Unless the parties agree in writing for Quantcast to provide campaign management services or professional services, the Services do not include those services.

**3.** **Accounts and Authorized Users**
========================================

3.1. Company will ensure its account information is accurate and current. Company will promptly notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of Company access credentials. Quantcast

may review and, if needed, correct, the information and setup associated with Company’s account and Authorized Users. Company must obtain Quantcast’s prior written consent before adding third-party Authorized Users (i.e., non-employees) and Quantcast may require such third-party Authorized Users to enter into separate terms with Quantcast.

3.2. “**Authorized User**” means an individual authorized by Company to use Company’s account on the Platform. Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users, the level of permissioning of each Authorized User, and all activity under its account, including the confidentiality of all access credentials. Without limiting the foregoing, Company will immediately notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of any access credentials. Company will ensure that all Authorized Users use Company’s account solely on behalf of Company, and are aware of, and comply with, this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is liable for any breach of this Agreement by any Authorized User.

**4.** **Company Clients**
==========================

If Company is using the Services on behalf of third-party clients (“**Clients**”), Company represents and warrants that it has all rights and authorizations needed to do so. Company will only use the Services for Clients with which Company has a direct written agency agreement and will obligate its Clients to comply with this Agreement, including the Incorporated Terms. Company is responsible for the actions and/or inactions of Clients and for ensuring their compliance.

**5.** **Fees and Payment**
===========================

5.1. Fees will be provided in the Platform or by other written means.

5.2. Unless Quantcast approves a different payment arrangement in writing, Company authorizes Quantcast to charge amounts owed under this Agreement after the end of each month to Company’s credit card, via automatic ACH, or such other similar payment method, at Quantcast’s option. Company will provide its most current credit card and/or other information required to complete payment, and keep such information updated if it changes. For the avoidance of doubt, if Company makes credit card, wire transfer or ACH payments or such other similar payment method, Company agrees to the applicable third-party terms as set forth in the Additional Terms. If Quantcast authorizes Company to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Quantcast may revise Company’s credit limit or require prepayment at any time in its sole discretion. Quantcast may charge interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments. Company is responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs that Quantcast incurs to collect unpaid invoices. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid for Services provided are non-refundable. If Company requires a purchase order to make payments, Company will include the corresponding purchase order number in the Platform. All amounts due must be paid without setoff or deduction.

5.3. Company is solely responsible for all amounts due for any Third-Party Services that Company opts to use. Company acknowledges that any charges for Third-Party Services shown in the Platform or otherwise provided by Quantcast are based on the information Quantcast receives from the third parties and are subject to the final amounts charged by such third parties.

5.4. Quantcast is the system of record and is solely responsible for calculating all metrics related to the Services, including all amounts owed under this Agreement. Company acknowledges that all metrics, fees and other amounts shown in Platform are preliminary and final amounts will be as confirmed, invoiced or billed by Quantcast.

5.5. All charges under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes and duties, if any. Company is responsible for and must pay all sales and use or other transactional taxes and duties including interest and penalty imposed on the amounts charged hereunder, or from the performance of this Agreement for which Quantcast issues an invoice. Company will promptly reimburse Quantcast for any such tax or duty and indemnify Quantcast and hold Quantcast harmless for any such taxes and duties that Quantcast must pay to a tax authority for which Company is responsible. If Company claims a tax exemption, Company must provide Quantcast with appropriate exemption certificates or documentation charges (including, without limitation, VAT or GST) acceptable to tax authorities.

**6.** **Services License and Requirements**
============================================

6.1. Company may use the Services solely as set forth in this Agreement. Subject to this Agreement, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to

(a) access and use the Services on a self-serve basis, and (b) use the Platform Data presented via the Services solely for the purpose of using the Services.

6.2. Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”). Company will not use the Services with Ads, Company Media, other content or products or services that violate any applicable laws, regulations, third-party rights, or this Agreement including the Incorporated Terms. If Company asks Quantcast to take actions on behalf of Company or otherwise assist with Company’s use of the Services, Company consents to the actions and/or inactions that Quantcast takes on its behalf and retains sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.

6.3. Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Services security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Services to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of a Client, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Services, including Platform Data, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Services or to end users, (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than the relevant Client who is obligated to treat such reports confidentially) or (g) use information collected during the course of Campaigns (e.g., via Company’s own tag, third party tags, etc.) outside Company’s use of the Services, including to create or enrich profiles of individual end users, including regarding third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video and other content/properties) that the end users have visited or the content or general interest area of such media. For example, Company may not create an audience of a particular publisher’s end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.

6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.

6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.

6.6. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.

**7.** **Data Issues**
======================

7.1. Data Definitions**:**

7.1.1. “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.

7.1.2. “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.

7.1.3. “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data under this Agreement. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags or Measure tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving or Quantcast Measure).

7.1.4. “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider).

Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.

7.1.5. “**Company Media**” means the Ads, websites, apps and other digital properties and content on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.

7.1.6. “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).

7.1.7. “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.

7.1.8. “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.

7.2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company

Data with any third-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non- Company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.

7.3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.

7.4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.

7.5. Models: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated for the purpose of Company’s Campaigns with other customers.

7.6. Client Data: Upon request from a Client (or an authorized third party on Client’s behalf, including Company), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.

7.7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.

**8.** **Compliance and Privacy**
=================================

8.1. Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.

8.2. Company will not use the Service or any Third Party Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or

(b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children; or (c) data related to any end user that has requested deletion or opted out (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

8.3. Company represents and warrants that it is not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and does not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations. If Company is using the Services on behalf of Clients, Company represents and warrants that Clients are not covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and do not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations.

**9.** **Third-Party Services**
===============================

9.1. If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.

9.2. Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.

9.3. Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

**10.** **Marketing, Publicity**
================================

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement.

**11.** **Confidentiality**
===========================

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

**12.** **Indemnity**
=====================

12.1. Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.

12.2. The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.

12.3. Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected and/or purchased by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.

12.4. If Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section 12 are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability and Company’s sole remedy as to infringement.

**13.** **Account Closure, Termination and Suspension**
=======================================================

13.1. Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure or termination of this Agreement, in addition to any other sections that by their nature would be presumed to, will survive account closure or termination.

13.2. Without limiting any other remedies, Quantcast may immediately suspend or terminate any individual Campaign, Authorized User’s access, and/or Company or Client account, including if Quantcast in its sole discretion suspects that a Campaign, Authorized User, Client, or Company is in breach this Agreement (including, without limitation, any failure to comply with the Incorporated Terms.

**14.** **DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 14.2 LIMITS ANY LIABILITY FOR FRAUD, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT LEGALLY BE LIMITED.

14.3. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO PAYMENTS DUE (SECTION 5), AND/OR INDEMNIFICATION (SECTION 12), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (US $100,000) OR (B) THE ACTUAL AMOUNT PAID AND/OR PAYABLE TO QUANTCAST FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO COMPANY IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE THE LIABILITY FIRST AROSE.

14.4. The limitations and exclusions contained in this Agreement represent the parties’ agreement based upon the perceived level of risk associated with this Agreement and the payments made hereunder.

**15.** **General**.

**QUANTCAST BUYER TERMS**

**Last Updated: May 3, 2024**

_If Company has an active, duly executed contract for one or more of the Services, that existing agreement will govern Company’s use of such Services within the scope of such agreement instead of these Quantcast Buyer Terms (“**Agreement**”)._

This Agreement is a legally binding contract between Quantcast and Company. “**Company**” means (A) when an individual accepts this Agreement on his or her own behalf, such individual, or (B) when an individual accepts this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, that company or legal entity. “**Quantcast**” means (X) Quantcast Corp. if Company is domiciled in the United States, (Y) Quantcast Australia Pty. Ltd. if Company is domiciled in any country or territory located in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and (Z) Quantcast International Limited if Company is domiciled in any other country or territory.

Quantcast may modify this Agreement. Quantcast will notify Company by making the revised version available on this page or an identified successor page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made. If Company does not accept the changes, Company must stop using the Services. Company’s continued use of the Services after Quantcast publishes changes means that Company consents to the updates.

**1\. Incorporated Terms**

This Agreement incorporates the following additional terms (“**Incorporated Terms**”), as updated from time to time:

* [Quantcast Campaign Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#campaign-policy) (“**Campaign Policy**”)
* [Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Buyers](https://legal.quantcast.com/#privacy-implementation-for-quantcast-advertiser-partners) (“**Privacy Implementation**”)
* [US State Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum), to the extent the Services include processing Personal Information subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in such Addendum) (“**DPA**”)
* [International Data Privacy Addendum](https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-data-privacy-addendum), to the extent that the Services include processing Personal Data subject to International Privacy Laws (as defined in such Addendum) (also “**DPA**”)
* Any applicable [Additional Terms](https://legal.quantcast.com/#additional-terms-ad-buyer) (defined below)

**2\. Services**

2.1. “**Services**” means the Quantcast platform (“**Platform**”) and, to the extent provided by Quantcast under this Agreement, Campaign Tags, Platform Data, and any other services provided by Quantcast. The Services may permit Company to purchase ad placements on third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video, and other content/properties) (“**Inventory**”) that are made available by third-party providers (“**Inventory Providers**”) and Third-Party Services (defined below). For clarity, the “Services” do not include Inventory or Third-Party Services.

2.2. Some Services may be subject to different or additional terms (“**Additional Terms**”) that are described on the Additional Terms page linked above, in the Platform or otherwise made available to Company in writing. Unless the parties agree in writing for Quantcast to provide campaign management services or professional services, the Services do not include those services.

**3\. Accounts and Authorized Users**

3.1. Company will ensure its account information is accurate and current. Company will promptly notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of Company access credentials. Quantcast may review and, if needed, correct, the information and setup associated with Company’s account and Authorized Users. Company must obtain Quantcast’s prior written consent before adding third-party Authorized Users (i.e., non-employees) and Quantcast may require such third-party Authorized Users to enter into separate terms with Quantcast.

3.2. “**Authorized User**” means an individual authorized by Company to use Company’s account on the Platform. Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users, the level of permissioning of each Authorized User, and all activity under its account, including the confidentiality of all access credentials. Without limiting the foregoing, Company will immediately notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of any access credentials. Company will ensure that all Authorized Users use Company’s account solely on behalf of Company, and are aware of, and comply with, this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is liable for any breach of this Agreement by any Authorized User.

**4\. Company Clients**

If Company is using the Services on behalf of third-party clients (“**Clients**”), Company represents and warrants that it has all rights and authorizations needed to do so. Company will only use the Services for Clients with which Company has a direct written agency agreement and will obligate its Clients to comply with this Agreement, including the Incorporated Terms. Company is responsible for the actions and/or inactions of Clients and for ensuring their compliance.

**5\. Fees and Payment**

5.1. Fees will be provided in the Platform or by other written means.

5.2. Unless Quantcast approves a different payment arrangement in writing, Company authorizes Quantcast to charge amounts owed under this Agreement after the end of each month to Company’s credit card, via automatic ACH, or such other similar payment method, at Quantcast’s option. Company will provide its most current credit card and/or other information required to complete payment, and keep such information updated if it changes. For the avoidance of doubt, if Company makes credit card, wire transfer or ACH payments or such other similar payment method, Company agrees to the applicable third-party terms as set forth in the Additional Terms. If Quantcast authorizes Company to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Quantcast may revise Company’s credit limit or require prepayment at any time in its sole discretion. Quantcast may charge interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments. Company is responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs that Quantcast incurs to collect unpaid invoices. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid for Services provided are non-refundable. If Company requires a purchase order to make payments, Company will include the corresponding purchase order number in the Platform. All amounts due must be paid without setoff or deduction.

5.3. Company is solely responsible for all amounts due for any Third-Party Services that Company opts to use. Company acknowledges that any charges for Third-Party Services shown in the Platform or otherwise provided by Quantcast are based on the information Quantcast receives from the third parties and are subject to the final amounts charged by such third parties.

5.4. Quantcast is the system of record and is solely responsible for calculating all metrics related to the Services, including all amounts owed under this Agreement. Company acknowledges that all metrics, fees and other amounts shown in Platform are preliminary and final amounts will be as confirmed, invoiced or billed by Quantcast.

5.5. All charges under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes and duties, if any. Company is responsible for and must pay all sales and use or other transactional taxes and duties including interest and penalty imposed on the amounts charged hereunder, or from the performance of this Agreement for which Quantcast issues an invoice. Company will promptly reimburse Quantcast for any such tax or duty and indemnify Quantcast and hold Quantcast harmless for any such taxes and duties that Quantcast must pay to a tax authority for which Company is responsible. If Company claims a tax exemption, Company must provide Quantcast with appropriate exemption certificates or documentation charges (including, without limitation, VAT or GST) acceptable to tax authorities.

**6\.** **Services** **License and Requirements**

6.1. Company may use the Services solely as set forth in this Agreement. Subject to this Agreement, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to (a) access and use the Services on a self-serve basis, and (b) use the Platform Data presented via the Services solely for the purpose of using the Services.

6.2. Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”). Company will not use the Services with Ads, Company Media, other content or products or services that violate any applicable laws, regulations, third-party rights, or this Agreement including the Incorporated Terms. If Company asks Quantcast to take actions on behalf of Company or otherwise assist with Company’s use of the Services, Company consents to the actions and/or inactions that Quantcast takes on its behalf and retains sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.

6.3. Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Services security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Services to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of a Client, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Services, including Platform Data, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Services or to end users, (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than the relevant Client who is obligated to treat such reports confidentially) or (g) use information collected during the course of Campaigns (e.g., via Company’s own tag, third party tags, etc.) outside Company’s use of the Services, including to create or enrich profiles of individual end users, including regarding third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video and other content/properties) that the end users have visited or the content or general interest area of such media. For example, Company may not create an audience of a particular publisher’s end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.

6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.

6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.

6.6. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.

**7\. Data** **Issues**

7.1. Data Definitions**:**

7.1.1. “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.

7.1.2. “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.

7.1.3. “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data under this Agreement. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags or Measure tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving or Quantcast Measure).

7.1.4. “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider). Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.

7.1.5. “**Company Media**” means the Ads, websites, apps and other digital properties and content on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.

7.1.6. “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).

7.1.7. “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.

7.1.8. “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.

7.2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company Data with any third-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non-Company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.

7.3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.

7.4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.

7.5. Models: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated for the purpose of Company’s Campaigns with other customers.

7.6. Client Data: Upon request from a Client (or an authorized third party on Client’s behalf, including Company), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client** **Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.

7.7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.

**8.** **Compliance and Privacy**

8.1. Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.

8.2. Company will not use the Service or any Third Party Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children; or (c) data related to any end user that has requested deletion or opted out (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

**9.****Third****\-Party Services**

9.1. If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.

9.2. Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.

9.3. Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

**10.****Marketing, Publicity**

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement.

**11.** **Confidentiality**

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

**12\.** **Indemnity**

12.1. Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.

12.2. The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.

12.3. Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected and/or purchased by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.

12.4. If Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section 12 are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability and Company’s sole remedy as to infringement.

**13.** **Account Closure, Termination and Suspension**

13.1. Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure or termination of this Agreement, in addition to any other sections that by their nature would be presumed to, will survive account closure or termination.

13.2. Without limiting any other remedies, Quantcast may immediately suspend or terminate any individual Campaign, Authorized User’s access, and/or Company or Client account, including if Quantcast in its sole discretion suspects that a Campaign, Authorized User, Client, or Company is in breach this Agreement (including, without limitation, any failure to comply with the Incorporated Terms.

This Agreement is a legally binding contract between Quantcast and Company. “**Company**” means (A) when an individual accepts this Agreement on his or her own behalf, such individual, or (B) when an individual accepts this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, that company or legal entity. “**Quantcast**” means (X) Quantcast Corp. if Company is domiciled in the United States, (Y) Quantcast Australia Pty.

Quantcast may modify this Agreement. Quantcast will notify Company by making the revised version available on this page or an identified successor page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made. If Company does not accept the changes, Company must stop using the Services. Company’s continued use of the Services after Quantcast publishes changes means that Company consents to the updates.

5.2. Unless Quantcast approves a different payment arrangement in writing, Company authorizes Quantcast to charge amounts owed under this Agreement after the end of each month to Company’s credit card, via automatic ACH, or such other similar payment method, at Quantcast’s option. Company will provide its most current credit card and/or other information required to complete payment, and keep such information updated if it changes. For the avoidance of doubt, if Company makes credit card, wire transfer or ACH payments or such other similar payment method, Company agrees to the applicable third-party terms as set forth in the Additional Terms. If Quantcast authorizes Company to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Quantcast may revise Company’s credit limit or require prepayment at any time in its sole discretion. Quantcast may charge interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments.

6. **Services License and Requirements**

6.1. Company may use the Services solely as set forth in this Agreement. Subject to this Agreement, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to (a) access and use the Platform on a self-serve basis, and (b) use the Platform Data presented in the Platform user interface solely for the purpose of using the Services.

6.2. If Company uses the Services to manage Campaigns and purchase Inventory, Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”), including ad creatives. Company will not use the Services with Ads that violate any applicable laws, regulations, third-party rights, or this Agreement including the Incorporated Terms.

For example, Company may not create an audience of Conde Nast end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.

  

6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.

6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.

6.6. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.

  

**7\. Data Issues**

7.1. Data Definitions**:**

7.1.1. “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.

7.1.2. “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.

7.1.3. “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving).

7.1.4. “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider). Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.

7.1.5. “**Company Media**” means the websites, apps and other digital properties or content associated with Ads, including the webpages, app screens and other digital properties on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.

7.1.6. “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).

7.1.7. “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.

  

7.1.8. “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.

7.2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third\-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company Data with any third\-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non-company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.

7.3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self\-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third\-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third\-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.

  

7.4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.

7.5. Models: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated in connection with Company’s Campaigns with other customers.

7.6. Client Data: Upon request from a Client, Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client** **Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.

7.7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.

  

8\. **Compliance and Privacy**

8.1. Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.

8.2. Company will not use the Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

9\. **Third\-Party Services**

9.1. If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.

9.2. Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.

9.3. Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

10\. **Marketing, Publicity**

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement (email sufficing).

11**. Confidentiality**

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

  

12**. Indemnity**

12.1. Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.

12.2. The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.

12.3. Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.

13.1. Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure and/or termination.

13.2.

Company will only use the Services for Clients with which Company has a direct written agreement and will obligate its Clients to comply with this Agreement, including the Incorporated Terms. Company is responsible for the actions and/or inactions of Clients and for ensuring their compliance.

**5\. Fees and Payment**

5.1 Fees will be provided in the Platform or by other written means.

5.2 Unless Quantcast approves a different payment arrangement in writing, Company authorizes Quantcast to charge amounts owed under this Agreement after the end of each month to Company’s credit card, via automatic ACH, or such other similar payment method, at Quantcast’s option. Company will provide its most current credit card and/or other information required to complete payment, and keep such information updated if it changes. For the avoidance of doubt, if Company makes credit card, wire transfer or ACH payments or such other similar payment method, Company agrees to the applicable third-party terms as set forth in the Additional Terms. If Quantcast authorizes Company to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Quantcast may revise Company’s credit limit or require prepayment at any time in its sole discretion. Quantcast may charge interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments. Company is responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs that Quantcast incurs to collect unpaid invoices. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid for Services provided are non-refundable. If Company requires a purchase order to make payments, Company will include the corresponding purchase order number in the Platform. All amounts due must be paid without setoff or deduction.

5.3. Company is solely responsible for all amounts due for any Third-Party Services (defined below) that Company opts to use. Company acknowledges that any charges for Third-Party Services shown in the Platform or otherwise provided by Quantcast are based on the information Quantcast receives from the third parties and are subject to the final amounts charged by such third parties.

5.4 Quantcast is the system of record and is solely responsible for calculating all metrics related to the Services, including all amounts owed under this Agreement. Company acknowledges that all amounts shown in Platform reporting are preliminary and final amounts will be as invoiced or billed by Quantcast.

5.5 All charges under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes and duties, if any. Company is responsible for and must pay all sales and use or other transactional taxes and duties including interest and penalty imposed on the amounts charged hereunder, or from the performance of this Agreement for which Quantcast issues an invoice. Company will promptly reimburse Quantcast for any such tax or duty and indemnify Quantcast and hold Quantcast harmless for any such taxes and duties that Quantcast must pay to a tax authority for which Company is responsible. If Company claims a tax exemption, Company must provide Quantcast with appropriate exemption certificates or documentation charges (including, without limitation, VAT or GST) acceptable to tax authorities.

  

6. **Services License and Requirements**

6.1. Company may use the Services solely as set forth in this Agreement. Subject to this Agreement, Quantcast grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to (a) access and use the Platform on a self-serve basis, and (b) use the Platform Data presented in the Platform user interface solely for the purpose of using the Services.

6.2. If Company uses the Services to manage Campaigns and purchase Inventory, Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”), including ad creatives. Company will not use the Services with Ads that violate any applicable laws, regulations, third-party rights, or this Agreement including the Incorporated Terms. If Company asks for Quantcast’s assistance with Company’s use of the Services, Company consents to the actions and/or inactions that Quantcast takes on its behalf and retains sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.

6.3. Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Platform security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Platform to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of a Client, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Services, including Platform Data, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Platform or to end users via Ads, (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than the relevant Client who is obligated to treat such reports confidentially) or (g) create or enrich profiles of individual end users on the basis of Campaign Data (defined below) or information derived from Campaign Data, including the third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video and other content/properties) that the end users have visited or the content or general interest area of such media. For example, Company may not create an audience of Conde Nast end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.

  

6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.

6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.

6.6. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.

  

**7\. Data Issues**

7.1. Data Definitions**:**

7.1.1. “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.

7.1.2. “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.

7.1.3. “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving).

7.1.4. “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider). Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.

7.1.5. “**Company Media**” means the websites, apps and other digital properties or content associated with Ads, including the webpages, app screens and other digital properties on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.

7.1.6. “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).

7.1.7. “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.

  

7.1.8. “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.

7.2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third\-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company Data with any third\-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non-company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.

7.3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self\-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third\-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third\-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.

  

7.4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.

7.5. Models: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated in connection with Company’s Campaigns with other customers.

7.6. Client Data: Upon request from a Client, Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client** **Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.

7.7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.

  

8\. **Compliance and Privacy**

8.1 Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.

8.2 Company will not use the Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

9\. **Third\-Party Services**

9.1 If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.

9.2. Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.

9.3. Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

10\. **Marketing, Publicity**

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement (email sufficing).

11**. Confidentiality**

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

  

12**. Indemnity**

12.1. Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.

12.2. The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.

12.3. Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.

12.4. If Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section 12 are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability and Company’s sole remedy as to infringement.

13**. Account Closure, Termination and Suspension**

13.1. Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure and/or termination.

13.2.

    * If Company uses the Services to manage Campaigns and purchase Inventory, Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”), including ad creatives. Company will not use the Services with Ads that violate any applicable laws, regulations, third-party rights, or this Agreement including the Incorporated Terms. If Company asks for Quantcast’s assistance with Company’s use of the Services, Company consents to the actions and/or inactions that Quantcast takes on its behalf and retains sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.
    * Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Platform security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Platform to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of a Client, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Services, including Platform Data, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Platform or to end users via Ads, (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than the relevant Client who is obligated to treat such reports confidentially) or (g) create or enrich profiles of individual end users on the basis of Campaign Data (defined below) or information derived from Campaign Data, including the third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video and other content/properties) that the end users have visited or the content or general interest area of such media. For example, Company may not create an audience of Conde Nast end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.
    * For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.
    * Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.
    * Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.

1. **Data Issues**
    * Data Definitions**:**
        * “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.
        * “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.
        * “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving).
        * “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider). Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.
        * “**Company Media**” means the websites, apps and other digital properties or content associated with Ads, including the webpages, app screens and other digital properties on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.
        * “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).
        * “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.
        * “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.
2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third\-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company Data with any third\-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non-company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.
3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self\-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third\-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third\-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.
4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.
5. Models: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated in connection with Company’s Campaigns with other customers.
6. Client Data: Upon request from a Client, Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client** **Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.
7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.
8. **Compliance and Privacy**
    * Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.
    * Company will not use the Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

* **Third\-Party Services**
    * If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.
    * Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.
    * Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

1. **Marketing, Publicity**

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement (email sufficing).

* **Confidentiality**

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

* **Indemnity**
    * Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.
    * The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.
    * Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.
    * If Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section 12 are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability and Company’s sole remedy as to infringement.
* **Account Closure, Termination and Suspension**
    * Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure and/or termination.
    * Without limiting any other remedies, Quantcast may immediately suspend or terminate any individual Campaign, Authorized User’s access, and/or Company or Client account, including if Quantcast in its sole discretion suspects that a Campaign, Authorized User, Client, or Company is in breach this Agreement (including failure to comply with the Incorporated Terms. If Quantcast suspends or closes Company’s account, Company may not re-open an account without Quantcast’s prior written approval.

1. **DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

QUANTCAST MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE BENEFITS FROM THE SERVICES, OR THAT THE PLATFORM OR ANY INFORMATION WILL BE ERROR-FREE, ALWAYS AVAILABLE OR OPERATE WITHOUT LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION.

**Last Updated: January 16, 2023**

Quantcast will notify Company by making the revised version available on this page or an identified successor page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made.

If Quantcast provides Company with the ability to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices upon receipt. Quantcast may revise Company’s credit limit or require prepayment at any time in its sole discretion.

    * If Company uses the Services to manage Campaigns and purchase Inventory, Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”), including ad creatives.

For example, Company may not create an audience of Conde Nast end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.
    * For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.
    * Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.

1. **Data Issues**
    * Data Definitions**:**
        * “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.
        * “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.
        * “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving).
        * “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider). Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.
        * “**Company Media**” means the websites, apps and other digital properties or content associated with Ads, including the webpages, app screens and other digital properties on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.
        * “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).
        * “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.
        * “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.
2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third\-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company Data with any third\-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non-company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.
3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self\-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third\-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third\-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.
4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.
5. Models: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company’s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated in connection with Company’s Campaigns with other customers.
6. Client Data: Upon request from a Client, Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client** **Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.
7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.
8. **Compliance and Privacy**
    * Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.
    * Company will not use the Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

* **Third\-Party Services**
    * If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.
    * Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.
    * Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

1. **Marketing, Publicity**

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement (email sufficing).

* **Confidentiality**

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

* **Indemnity**
    * Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.
    * The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.
    * Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.
    * If Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section 12 are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability and Company’s sole remedy as to infringement.
* **Account Closure, Termination and Suspension**
    * Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure and/or termination.
    * Without limiting any other remedies, Quantcast may immediately suspend or terminate any individual Campaign, Authorized User’s access, and/or Company or Client account, including if Quantcast in its sole discretion suspects that a Campaign, Authorized User, Client, or Company is in breach this Agreement (including failure to comply with the Incorporated Terms. If Quantcast suspends or closes Company’s account, Company may not re-open an account without Quantcast’s prior written approval.

1. **DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**
    1. QUANTCAST MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE BENEFITS FROM THE SERVICES, OR THAT THE PLATFORM OR ANY INFORMATION WILL BE ERROR-FREE, ALWAYS AVAILABLE OR OPERATE WITHOUT LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION.

**QUANTCAST MASTER BUYER TERMS**

**Last Updated: January 16, 2023**

_If Company has an active, duly executed contract for one or more of the Services, that existing agreement will govern Company’s use of such Services within the scope of such agreement instead of this Quantcast Master Services Agreement (“**Agreement**”)._

Quantcast may modify this Agreement. Quantcast will notify Company by making the revised version available on this page or an identified successor page, and an updated revision date will indicate that changes have been made. If Company does not accept the changes, Company must stop using the Services. Company’s continued use of the Services after Quantcast publishes changes means that Company consents to the updates.

    * Unless Quantcast approves a different payment arrangement in writing, Company authorizes Quantcast to charge amounts owed under this Agreement to Company’s credit card, or to receive payment via wire transfer, automatic ACH, or such other similar payment method, at Quantcast’s option. Company will provide its most current credit card and/or other information required to complete payment, and keep such information updated if it changes. For the avoidance of doubt, if Company makes credit card, wire transfer or ACH payments or such other similar payment method, Company agrees to the applicable third-party terms as set forth in the Additional Terms. If Quantcast provides Company with the ability to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices upon receipt. Quantcast may revise Company’s credit limit or require prepayment at any time in its sole discretion. Quantcast may charge interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments.

    * All charges under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes and duties, if any. Company is responsible for and must pay all sales and use or other transactional taxes and duties including interest and penalty imposed on the amounts charged hereunder, or from the performance of this Agreement for which Quantcast issues an invoice. Company will promptly reimburse Quantcast for any such tax or duty and indemnify Quantcast and hold Quantcast harmless for any such taxes and duties that Quantcast must pay to a tax authority for which Company is responsible. If Company claims a tax exemption, Company must provide Quantcast with appropriate exemption certificates or documentation charges (including, without limitation, VAT or GST) acceptable to tax authorities.

    * If Company uses the Services to manage Campaigns and purchase Inventory, Company will obtain all rights necessary to perform tracking and analytics, and store and serve the advertisements (“**Ads**”) associated with Company’s campaigns (“**Campaigns**”), including ad creatives. Company will not use the Services with Ads that violate any applicable laws, regulations, third-party rights, or this Agreement including the Incorporated Terms. If Company asks for Quantcast’s assistance with Company’s use of the Services, Company consents to the actions and/or inactions that Quantcast takes on its behalf and retains sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.
    * Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Platform security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Platform to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of a Client, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Services, including Platform Data, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Platform or to end users via Ads, (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than the relevant Client who is obligated to treat such reports confidentially) or (g) create or enrich profiles of individual end users on the basis of Campaign Data (defined below) or information derived from Campaign Data, including the third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video and other content/properties) that the end users have visited or the content or general interest area of such media. For example, Company may not create an audience of Conde Nast end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.
    * For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers’ use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.
    * Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.
    * Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.

1. **Data Issues**
    * Data Definitions**:**
        * “**Aggregated Data**” means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.
        * “**Campaign Data**” means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.
        * “**Campaign Tag**” means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data. For clarity, the term “Campaign Tags” does not refer to any ad serving tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving).
        * “**Company Data**” means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company’s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider). Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company’s Confidential Information.
        * “**Company Media**” means the websites, apps and other digital properties or content associated with Ads, including the webpages, app screens and other digital properties on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.
        * “**Model**” means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).
        * “**Platform Data**” means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (“**Third-Party Data**”). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast’s Confidential Information.
        * “**Tag Data**” means the data collected via Campaign Tags.
2. Company Data: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third\-party on Company’s or a Client’s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company Data with any third\-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non-company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.
3. Platform Data: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self\-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third\-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement_._ If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third\-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.
4. Campaign Data: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company’s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement.

Client Data: Upon request from a Client, Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, “**Client** **Data**” means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast’s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.
7. No Off-Platform Use: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.
8. **Compliance and Privacy**
    * Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (“**DAA**”) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (“**NAI**”). “**Applicable Privacy Laws**” means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.
    * Company will not use the Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or (b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children (collectively, “**Prohibited Data**”). “**Direct Identifier**” means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, “**children**” refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.

* **Third\-Party Services**
    * If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (“**Third-Party Service**”), the following additional terms apply.
    * Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.
    * Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).

1. **Marketing, Publicity**

Quantcast may include Company’s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast’s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast’s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast’s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party’s prior agreement (email sufficing).

* **Confidentiality**

“**Confidential Information**” means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.

* **Indemnity**
    * Quantcast shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its directors, officers, employees and agents, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Company Parties**”) against any claim, liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (“**Liabilities**”) incurred by the Company Parties in connection with any third-party claim (including any regulatory or governmental action) (“**Claim**”) that Quantcast’s proprietary technology that provides the Services, in the form provided by Quantcast, infringes any patent or other third-party intellectual property right. Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Quantcast, its affiliated entities, and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents, and its and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (“**Quantcast Parties**”) against any Liabilities incurred by the Quantcast Parties in connection with any Claim arising out of or relating to (a) Company’s (including any Client’s, if applicable) use of the Services or Third-Party Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) Company Data or Ads; (c) the nature of Company’s or any Client’s products, services and industry, including without limitation any claims in the nature of product liability or any claim or allegation that such services or products are not in compliance with applicable industry-specific laws, or (d) breach of Sections 6.2. 6.3, 7 or 8.
    * The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party’s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.
    * Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company’s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.
    * If Quantcast’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast’s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement. Quantcast’s obligations as stated in this Section 12 are Quantcast’s sole and exclusive liability and Company’s sole remedy as to infringement.
* **Account Closure, Termination and Suspension**
    * Company may close its account at any time via the Platform. Quantcast may terminate this Agreement upon notice for any reason or no reason. Sections 5, 6.6, 7 and 11-15 will survive account closure and/or termination.
    * Without limiting any other remedies, Quantcast may immediately suspend or terminate any individual Campaign, Authorized User’s access, and/or Company or Client account, including if Quantcast in its sole discretion suspects that a Campaign, Authorized User, Client, or Company is in breach this Agreement (including failure to comply with the Incorporated Terms.

Quantcast will make available information about its data processing, as well as a means for users to exercise their data subject rights and other information required by European Privacy Laws, in its Products and Services Privacy Policy at [www.quantcast.com/privacy](http://www.quantcast.com/privacy). Quantcast will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to enhance the security of its processing of Personal Data.
    2. In addition to any obligations set forth in Agreement, Company will ensure that it has a legal basis for the collection and processing of Personal Data. Company will make available information about its data processing and other information required by European Privacy Laws in its privacy policy.
    3. If any user exercises its rights under European Privacy Laws with respect to the parties' processing of Personal Data collected by Quantcast from Online Properties on which Company placed Tags, or if Company is contacted by a supervisory authority with regard to such processing, Company will, promptly and no later than seven (7) days following receipt of the request, forward all relevant information regarding such requests to Quantcast at [privacy.qil@quantcast.com](mailto:privacy.qil@quantcast.com). Quantcast agrees to respond to such requests as required by European Privacy Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is not authorized to answer on Quantcast’s behalf.

1. **Canadian** **Privacy Laws.**

This section applies to the extent that Canadian Privacy Laws apply, including where Online Properties are accessed by individuals in Canada and where Company Information that includes Personal Data subject to Canadian Privacy Laws is provided (whether provided directly by Company or via third parties on Company’s behalf).

1. Quantcast agrees that any Company Information received from the Company or exposed to it in connection with the Agreement in Canada is done so solely for the Authorized Purposes, and Quantcast acquires no right or interest in or to the Company Information except as set out in the Agreement.
2. Quantcast will not use any Company Information provided or disclosed by the Company for any purpose other than that for which it was provided or disclosed to it, and as authorized in the Agreement.

3. Quantcast will implement safeguards to protect against the loss, disclosure, alteration or misuse of Company Information that is in its care or custody, and will protect Company Information with the same degree of care and diligence that Quantcast uses to protect and safeguard its own like information, but not less than the degree of care that would be exercised by a reasonable person given the sensitivity of such Company Information.
4. Quantcast will cooperate as may be necessary to assist in any access or other individual requests, questions, complaints, audits and any investigations related to Company Information. In the event that Quantcast is contacted by any individual whose Personal Data is the subject of the Agreement or this Addendum, or by any person (including a regulator) respecting the Agreement, Quantcast will refer them to the Company and will promptly give the Company’s Privacy Officer notice of such contact.

5. Quantcast will only retain Company Information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the Authorized Purposes.
6. In the event that Quantcast becomes legally required to disclose any Company Information, Quantcast shall provide Company with prompt notice (unless Quantcast is prohibited from doing so) in order for Company to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Addendum. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, Quantcast shall furnish only that portion of the Company Information which is legally required to be furnished in the opinion of Quantcast’s counsel.
7. In addition to the requirements in Section 2 above, Company will provide users with information about transfers of Company Information outside of Canada and/or Quebec.

For clarity, “_Third Party Costs_” as used in the Agreement shall include the LiveRamp Fees.

#### Opt-Out Rights

As further described in the [Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/) and the [Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy](https://www.quantcast.com/legal/privacy-website/), under applicable law, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal information:

* Right to object (marketing): The right to object to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes at any time. 
* Right to object (legitimate interests): The right to object to the processing of your personal information where we process it on the basis of our legitimate interests.
* Right to restrict processing: The right, in certain cases, to temporarily restrict the processing of your personal information by us, provided there are valid grounds for doing so.
* Right to withdraw your consent: The right to withdraw the consent you have provided at any time, where we process your personal information on the basis of your consent.
* Right to opt out of certain uses or disclosures of your personal information, including the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information and the use of your personal information for “targeted advertising” (as these terms are defined under applicable law). 

Quantcast provides the ability to exercise these rights by giving you the opt-out options described below. We offer cookie-based and cookieless opt-out methods that allow you to exercise the above-listed rights. Both of these methods are specific to the browser you are using; that means that you must opt-out separately in every browser that you use. Additionally, your device and/or app settings and features may allow you to exercise certain choices and legal rights. 

  

##### Cookie-Based Web Browser Opt-Out

The opt-out below will set an opt-out cookie in your web browser. Later, when you are on other websites using this same browser profile and we see the opt-out cookie, we will know the selection you have made and will act accordingly.

Important things to know about the cookie-based opt-out for web browsers:

* This opt-out will stop our services from collecting and using personal information linked to your browser for interest-based advertising purposes
* You will still continue to see ads after opting out, but they may be less relevant to you  
* If your opt-out cookie is deleted or blocked, we will no longer be able to see your selection and you will need to set your cookie preferences again 
* If you use different browsers, browser profiles, or devices, you will have to opt out separately on those since we are not able to access the opt-out cookie across different browsers or devices
* This opt-out is for web browsers, not mobile apps or video or game platforms; see below for additional details 
* This opt-out is also not for audience matched advertising that uses identifiers based on email addresses, phone numbers, or other direct identifiers; see below for additional details
* This opt-out will not unsubscribe you from Quantcast’s marketing emails; see the [Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy](https://www.quantcast.com/legal/privacy-website/) to learn more about your email marketing choices 
* This opt out will not affect your Consent Management Platform (CMP) selections. A CMP is a process, usually a pop-up, that a website/digital property uses to assist them in managing users’ privacy preferences in relation to cookies and to help them meet their transparency obligations under data protection and privacy laws. When a user visits a website and is presented with banners, pop-ups, or sliders to manage their cookie preferences, these options are often being managed using a CMP.

##### Cookieless Web Browser Opt-Out

If you disable cookies in your browser, or use a browser that does not allow cookies, we cannot associate your opt-out selection with cookies. Instead, we associate your opt-out selection with a unique identifier based on your device’s IP address and other information about your device, and we will stop collecting and using personal information from your device for interest-based advertising purposes based on the IP address-based identifier. 

Your IP address may change over time or as you move between networks (e.g., between home and office). When your browser moves to a new IP address, it will have a new IP-based identifier. Your previous opt-out selections will not be associated with the new IP-based identifier. We will collect and use personal information for interest-based advertising purposes based on the new IP address-based identifier until you opt-out from the new IP address. Important things to know about the cookieless opt-out for web browsers

* This opt-out will stop our services from collecting and using personal information linked to your web browser for interest-based advertising purposes
* You will continue to still see ads after opting out, but they may be less relevant to you,  
* If you use different browsers, browser profiles, or devices, you will have to opt out separately on those, since the IP address-based identifier would be different for each one 
* Because our opt-out is based on your device’s IP address and other information about your device, if that information changes, the identifier we use will change and an opt-out from a previous identifier will not be applied to the new IP address until you opt-out from the new IP address
* This opt-out is for web browsers, not mobile apps or video or game platforms; see below for additional details
* This opt-out is also not for audience matched advertising that uses identifiers based on email addresses, phone numbers, or other direct identifiers; see below for additional details
* This opt-out will not unsubscribe you from Quantcast’s marketing emails; see the [Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy](https://legal.quantcast.com/#quantcast-website-and-corporate-privacy-policy) to learn more about your email marketing choices  
* This opt out will not affect your Consent Management Platform (CMP) selections. A CMP is a process, usually a pop-up, that a website/digital property uses to assist them in managing users’ preferences and to help them meet their transparency obligations under data protection and privacy laws. When a user visits a website and is presented with banners, pop-ups or sliders to manage their cookie preferences, these options are often being managed using a CMP.

In addition to the cookieless opt-out described above, in order to meet our obligations under applicable law, we follow a strict data minimization process. Specifically, we use each IP address-based identifier for a maximum of 30 days. After that time, we create a different identifier, which we do not link to the previous identifier. Data is retained with the prior identifier for up to 30 additional days for security and anti-fraud purposes. Therefore, if you wish for Quantcast to stop processing personal information it has about you in association with an IP-address based identifier, such processing will cease within 30 days for all purposes except security and anti-fraud, which will cease after 60 days.

**Additional Web Browser Opt-Out Options**

##### Industry Web Browser Opt-Outs

You may opt out of interest-based advertising from certain companies by using one or more of the following industry opt-out pages: 

* in the US: [https://youradchoices.com/](https://youradchoices.com/) and [https://optout.networkadvertising.org/](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/)  
* in Europe: [https://youronlinechoices.com/](https://youronlinechoices.com/) 
* in Canada: [https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=3&lang=en](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=3&lang=en)

Please note that the list of industry opt-out tools above is not intended to be exhaustive and there may be a different opt-out tool/consumer choice mechanism available in your country/region. Please also note that not all companies that participate in industry opt-out options offer a cookieless opt-out option at this time.

##### Global Privacy Control

Global Privacy Control (“ GPC ”) is a preference that you can set in certain web browsers to inform the websites you visit that you do not want information about your online activity collected over time and across third-party websites or online services. We honor GPC for data subjects in the United States.

See the [Global Privacy Control Organization page](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) for detailed instructions on how to enable GPC in your web browser.

##### Web Browser Opt-Outs using Consent Management Platforms

Quantcast has integrated with IAB Europe’s TCF v2 and, where website publishers have implemented TCF-compliant Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) on their properties, users are able to manage their choices with respect to the processing of personal information collected on the website through the CMPs on the relevant website. 

Screenshot examples of a CMP are below for illustrative purposes. A user can opt out by moving the toggle to the appropriate setting. In the first example, a user can opt out by moving the toggle to the right, in which case the toggle will indicate that the user has opted out by turning red and displaying an “x”. In the second example, the user can opt out by moving the toggle to the left, in which case the toggle will be changed to “off.”

##### Non-Web Browser Opt-Outs: Mobile Devices, TVs, and Other Devices

Both the cookie-based and cookieless opt-out options described above work with web browsers only. Though different browsers have different privacy settings, the underlying technology is similar from one browser to the next. 

For mobile devices, TVs, streaming boxes, game consoles, etc., every manufacturer chooses their own approach; it is not standardised. Moreover, different apps on those platforms might have their own privacy settings. 

**Mobile Devices** 

When using web browsers on mobile devices, the browser-specific opt-out mechanisms described above apply.

For mobile apps, because we are unable to set an opt-out cookie that we can access across different apps, you will need to consult your device’s settings for instructions on how to manage your privacy and advertising choices. See the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Mobile Opt-Out page](https://thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out/) for detailed instructions on how to set opt-out preferences on your device.

**TVs and Other Devices**

For TVs and other streaming devices, because we are unable to set an opt-out cookie that we can access across different devices and apps, you will need to consult your device’s settings for instructions on how to manage your privacy and advertising choices. See the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Connected TV Choices page](https://thenai.org/opt-out/connected-tv-choices/) for detailed instructions on how to set opt-out preferences on your TV or streaming device. Additionally, particular apps on TVs or gaming devices might offer their own privacy settings. Again, check their settings and documentation for details. 

##### Opt-Out of Sharing Location Information

Some devices, particularly mobile devices, offer specific settings that control the sharing of location information. Check your devices’ and apps’ privacy settings and documentation for details.

##### Opt-Out of Email-Based Matched Advertising

Some companies, with appropriate permissions, might use your email address to create an identifier that can be matched across websites, apps, and devices and used for interest-based advertising purposes. 

The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) has a web-based tool (available [here](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/optout/email)) that allows users to opt out of participating members’ use of their email addresses for advertising purposes.

#### Additional Data Subject Rights

Depending on your U.S. state or country of residence, you may have the right to exercise additional privacy choices and legal rights with respect to your personal information under applicable law, as described below.

##### Right of erasure/deletion

The right, in certain cases, to request that we delete your personal information, provided there are valid grounds for doing so and subject to applicable law.

##### Right to data portability

In certain circumstances, the right to receive a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit such information to another controller

#### U.S. Residents

##### Do Not Sell My Personal Information

We may share personal information about visitors to the [Quantcast.com](http://quantcast.com/) domain with our analytics and advertising partners in ways that may constitute “sales” or “sharing” under certain U.S. state privacy laws. Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may have the right to opt out of personal information “sales” or “sharing” and “targeted advertising” (as these terms are defined under applicable law) by Quantcast. 

**Do Not Sell My Personal Information**

If you enable the Global Privacy Control (GPC) browser-based opt-out preference signal, upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request and respond to it appropriately according to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each one that you use.
