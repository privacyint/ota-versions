3. You should be the right age to use the app. Your Institution may set age limits.
4. We do not ask for your personal data unless it is needed for your Institution. We only collect the data we need to help you. Read our privacy policy and related policies to understand how we use your data.
5. The AI Coach is an artificial intelligence powered software, not a real person, so is restricetd in the means of response. The AI Coach is meant to provide evidence-based tools and techniques and to encourage mental well-being in a self-help and self-monitoring context. It will not offer medical or clinical advice and will only suggest that you seek ptofessional help.

They listen without judging and help you solve problems. Our service encourages and supports you to be mentally stronger and to be able to achieve your goals.
8. The Wysa Medical Assistant uses audio-video or text-based messaging to provide healthcare services.
9. You can talk and video chat with a Wysa Coach or Wysa Medical Assistant only when it is allowed. If you do not see this option in your app, it means the service maybe unavailable in your region.
10. Wysa coaches or Wysa Medical Assistant are not meant to replace face-to-face visits to a doctor or psychiatrist. They do not give diagnoses, treatments, monitors or cures for diseases or conditions. They are there to support and help you, not to treat illnesses.
11. If you are using the app as a part of Wysa Co-pilot services offered by your Institution, your Institution can assign a clinician or well-being advisor to provide you the necessary support. They can use audio-video or text-based messaging to support you.
12. The app can help with general mental health but not with severe or enduring physical or mental health conditions. If you have health problems, check with your local clinician before using the app.
13. Where you use voice based services of our AI coach, the intended purpose is to provide support to manage your mental well-being. The voice based service is not intended for emergency purposes.
14. Keep your conversations private and follow safety rules to secure your data.

Intended Use Of Our App and Services:

With the apps, you can chat with an artificial intelligence (AI) coach to get access to tools and techniques to help manage your emotions and support your mental and behavioural health and well-being.

**Wysa App intended use**

The app is an AI-driven conversational agent intended to assist individuals with subclinical or clinical symptoms of anxiety or low mood in managing emotional distress through evidence based techniques such as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, goal setting and emotional acceptance. The software provides feedback and personalised insights based on user-input data and helps users set meaningful personal goals and take actionable steps towards positive change. It is intended for use by individuals over the age of 13 (or as agreed by the Institutional provider) as a stand alone support tool or in conjunction with regular physical or mental health focussed clinical care (during waiting periods, between appointments, and/or as an adjunct to individual or group therapy). It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, and does not provide medical advice or diagnoses. It is not recommended for use in crisis situations, nor is it suitable for use by those with severe and enduring mental health problems.

**About the AI Coach service**

* The AI Coach is not a human, but an artificial intelligence system. So it is restricted in the means of response.
* The app provides evidence-based tools to help you feel better and manage your mood.
* The AI Coach cannot provide any medical advice.
* It can help with general mental health but not with severe or enduring physical or mental health conditions.
* It cannot offer condition specific advice for any medical conditions nor is it intended to provide a diagnosis, prognosis, treatment or cure of any illnesses, disability or health conditions.
* If you are between 13 and 18 years or where approved by your Institution, we may seek parental consent to use our service as required by applicable laws in your country of residence. You will require your parents or guardian to send their consent to [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or to your Institution if you are an Institutional user.

**About the Wysa Coach service**

* The Wysa Coach is a mental health and well-being professional.
* The Wysa coaches use proven methods and tools to train you to be mentally resilient.
* You may need to give consent and permissions to use the service.
* You might also need to give us details of a person to contact in an emergency for your safety.
* If you are between 13 and 18 years or where approved by your Institution, we may seek parental consent to use our service as required by applicable laws in your country of residence. You will require your parents or guardian to send their consent to [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or to your Institution if you are an Institutional user.
* Where decided by us or your Institution, the Wysa Coach conducts online group well-being sessions.

**About the Digital Front Door Service**  
The service is given to you by your Institution. It helps your Institution guide you and your family to the right care and support. The service asks a series of questions, and based on your answers, it shows you the right resources your Institution offers for your mental health and well-being.

**About the Generative AI or Wysa+ Service**  

By default, Wysa AI Coach uses proprietary artificial intelligence and third-party Generative AI (“Gen AI”) to provide the service. Users on older versions of the App will continue to avail the on-demand Wysa+ services. Where opted by you, Wysa+ uses third-party Gen AI along with our proprietary AI to chat with you.

The Gen AI or Wysa+ provides an improved experience of the AI Coach service. It allows us to provide you with high-quality, and safe responses. This helps the AI Coach talk about varied conversations and provide responses that are more suited to you. Where provided, the AI Coach allows you to chat in native English. Your conversation data is processed and part of the input to the Gen AI to provide this service. The input to and the output from the Gen AI passes through our safety guardrails and quality checks before we use it. Our clinical staff checks the appropriateness of the Gen AI response at frequent intervals to make sure they are safe, and work well.

Generated Insights within Weekly Report:  
Where you use weekly reports, we use third-party Gen AI to create generated insights. These reports give you personalized and useful information based on how you use the app. This can help you learn more about yourself and improve your mental health and well-being.

**About the Wysa Medical Assistant Service**  
Healthcare services are offered through our Medical Assistants. Wysa Medical Assistants are allied health professionals who have been trained to offer healthcare services in a remote setting. They provide the service on behalf and under the supervision of care coordinators. Medical Assistants will help you adapt to living healthier lives by discovering your personal strengths and motivations, along with enabling adherence to your medication and appointments. The Medical Assistant will not be prescribing medicines or dosages.

**Digital Referral Assistant application (“DRA” or “Referral web widget”) intended use**  

* The DRA is an AI enabled conversational agent software designed to support client services (“Institution”) that offer and/or provide mental health care.
* The DRA collects and transfers a range of demographic and screening information, as defined and agreed by the client service, to Electronic Patient Record (EPR/EHR) systems for review by the client service clinician.
* The DRA software uses transparent conditional logic to minimise the question flow for individual users and surface flags to indicate priority areas for client service clinician attention.
* The DRA software is intended for use in adults age 16 or older and does not suggest potential diagnoses or replace clinical judgement.

**About the DRA services**  

* The DRA enables you to self-refer into and find out if you qualify for certain mental health services.
* Wysa does not decide who gets the help, nor the type or step of care provided – we just help collect the required information and pass it to your Institution and their EPR/EHR.
* The rules for eligibility are set by the Institution providing the service, not by Wysa.
* Your information is shared with the Institution and/or their service providers, to help them provide the right care for you.
* The DRA cannot offer condition specific advice for any medical conditions nor is it intended to provide a diagnosis, prognosis, treatment or cure of any illnesses, disability or health conditions.
* The client service clinician uses the data transferred for checking symptoms to provide appropriate care and not for diagnoses.

**Wysa Therapist Companion or Co-Pilot intended use**  

* The Wysa Therapist companion is a web based portal designed to work alongside our WYSA app or of its own. The web portal is designed to support medical assistants or clinicians or well-being advisors (together the “advisors”) from Provider Institutions to assign tools and resources for users to complete within the WYSA app. It allows the advisors to reach out to users’, to review users' engagement with resources within the WYSA app and to send messages. The advisors are also able to receive messages if configured. When integrated, information can be transferred to the user's health notes in the Institution’s Electronic Patient Record System. The system is intended for use by the advisors only.

**Privacy and Data Handling**  
Please read our Privacy Policy to see how we protect and handle your data.

* The app is not for use in crisis or emergencies.
