##### 1\. California

### ​

If you are a California resident, this section applies to you. This section, combined with the above, describes how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information in our capacity as a “business” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (together with the CCPA, “CPRA”), and the rights that you have with respect to your personal information, including sensitive personal information. For purposes of this section, “personal information” and “sensitive personal information” have the meanings given in the CPRA and do not include information excluded from the CPRA’s scope.

Clearview does not sell your personal information, as that term is traditionally understood.  However, Clearview’s disclosure of photos collected from the Internet is deemed a “sale” under the CPRA.  To opt out of the sale of your personal information, please see the instructions below. Clearview does not “share” personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. Clearview does not have actual knowledge of the age of the persons in the photos it collects from the Internet.  As such, Clearview does not knowingly sell or share personal information about consumers under the age of 16. 

California’s Shine the Light law, California Civil Code § 1798.83, permits California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we disclosed personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. Please note that Clearview does not currently disclose your personal information to any third parties for marketing purposes. However, if you are a California resident and have any questions, please contact us by emailing [privacy@clearview.ai](mailto:privacy@clearview.ai).

“Do Not Track.” Please note that we do not respond to Do Not Track requests. However, we do honor opt-out of sale requests, as noted below.​

Under the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), California Civil Code § 1798.100, et seq., California residents have additional privacy rights, which you can learn more about by visiting our California Privacy section, which is [located here under “State-Specific Information and Rights”](https://www.clearview.ai/privacy-policy).

You may submit a request for opt-out of appearance in Clearview search results using this [webform](https://www.clearview.ai/privacy-and-requests) or by calling our toll-free number 1(866) 637-0257 and following our instructions. We will honor your request within fifteen (15) business days. ​

​

​

Your Right to Non-Discrimination 

​

The CPRA prohibits businesses from discriminating against California consumers for exercising any of their rights under the CPRA. This includes us not: (a) denying you goods or services; (b) charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; (c) providing you a different level or quality of goods or services; (d) suggesting to you that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services; and (e) retaliating against you for exercising your privacy rights.

​

Your Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Your Sensitive Personal Information

Under the CPRA, certain types of personal information are considered “sensitive” personal information and require additional data privacy rights and obligations. Clearview collects driver’s license, state identification card and passport (“ID Information”), account login information, and face vectors and photos, and such metadata as image files may contain (“Face Vector Data”), which may be deemed sensitive personal information under the CPRA. You may limit any use and disclosure of your Face Vector Data by submitting a photo of yourself along with California resident proof (i.e., government-issued documentation). We will honor your request within fifteen (15) business days.

Please note that we will only use ID Information to honor your privacy rights request and your account login information to provide you our services. We also only use these types of sensitive personal information for other limited purposes permitted under the CPRA for sensitive data. As such, there is no need to exercise a right to limit use and disclosure of ID Information and account login information, as we do not use it for any purposes beyond that permitted for sensitive personal information under the CPRA.

To respond to some rights we may need to authenticate you by providing additional information.

If you are a Virginia resident, this section applies to you. This section, combined with the general privacy Policy above, describes how we collect, use, and disclose your personal data under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”), and the rights that you have with respect to your personal data, including sensitive data. 

Your Virginia Rights Regarding Your Personal Data. Virginia law provides Virginia residents with the rights listed below. To exercise these rights see the “Exercising your Virginia Privacy Rights” section below. 

Right to Confirmation of Processing and Access to Personal Data in Portable Format. You have the right to confirm whether we are processing your personal data and access such personal data in a portable format. You may submit a verifiable consumer request up to two (2) times in a twelve(12)-month period for access to your personal data. When you submit an access request, you can request that we deliver the information to you by mail or electronically. If you elect to receive the information electronically, to the extent it is technically feasible for us to do so, we will provide the requested information in a portable and readily usable format. 

Right to Request Deletion. If you want us to delete the personal data we have collected from you, you can send us a verifiable consumer request requesting that we delete some or all of the information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your request, we will delete your personal data in our active records, unless an exception applies. In the event that we deny your request to delete based on an exception or another ground under the CDPA, we will inform you, in writing, of the reason.

Right to Correct. You have the right to request us to correct inaccurate personal information we maintain about you.

Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of targeted advertising, sale of your personal data (as defined under Virginia law), the collection and use of personal data, and profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer.  Please note that we do not use your personal data for targeted advertising. As such, we do not offer an opt-out of targeted advertising rights. 

Right to Non-Discrimination. The CDPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against Virginia consumers for exercising any of their rights under the CDPA. This includes us not: (a) denying you goods or services; (b) charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; (c) providing you a different level or quality of goods or services; (d) suggesting to you that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services; and (e) retaliating against you for exercising your privacy rights.

Exercising Your Virginia Privacy Rights. In order for us to process a privacy rights request made pursuant to the CDPA, it is necessary for us to verify your identity. We cannot fulfill your request if we cannot verify your identity.

​

We will respond to your privacy rights request within forty-five (45) calendar days of receipt, or up to a total of ninety (90) calendar days if additional time is needed. In the event that we cannot complete your request within the initial forty-five (45) calendar day period, we will notify you in writing within the initial forty-five (45) calendar day period.
